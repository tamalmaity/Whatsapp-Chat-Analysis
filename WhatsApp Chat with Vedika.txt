15/03/20, 12:47 am - Vedika: About what?
15/03/20, 12:47 am - Tamal: I have been crying since I texted you last
15/03/20, 12:47 am - Vedika: Errr why?
15/03/20, 12:48 am - Tamal: Idk. That is what's annoying. I can't figire out.

15/03/20, 12:48 am - Tamal: I am sorry to bother you
15/03/20, 12:48 am - Tamal: Like this
15/03/20, 12:48 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs okay. Don‚Äôt need to figure it out.
15/03/20, 12:48 am - Vedika: You‚Äôre not.
15/03/20, 12:49 am - Tamal: I have had breakdowns pehle bhi. I thought these were gone man.
15/03/20, 12:49 am - Vedika: Abrupt goodbyes are hard. If you want I can fade it out for you.
15/03/20, 12:49 am - Tamal: No. Dude. You triggered it.
15/03/20, 12:49 am - Tamal: But you're not it
15/03/20, 12:49 am - Tamal: I figured that out
15/03/20, 12:49 am - Vedika: What? I‚Äôm so sorry. I know I can be very mean sometimes. Shit.
15/03/20, 12:50 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm so sorry man. I didn‚Äôt mean to.
15/03/20, 12:50 am - Tamal: No n9
15/03/20, 12:50 am - Tamal: Dudeee
15/03/20, 12:50 am - Tamal: Nahi samajh rahi tu
15/03/20, 12:50 am - Tamal: Sunn. Go do whatever you're doing. I am going to tell you what I feel in a long ass text
15/03/20, 12:50 am - Tamal: When you see it come back
15/03/20, 12:50 am - Tamal: Okay?
15/03/20, 12:50 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm not doing anything
15/03/20, 12:50 am - Vedika: Bolo aaram se
15/03/20, 12:50 am - Tamal: Okay okay.
15/03/20, 1:01 am - Tamal: Sunn. I haven't had much luck with love okay. Kabhi bhi. Not in school, not in college kabhi bhi. I have distanced myself from people who had genuine feelings for me. I don't know why. I have lost many close friends like that. I gave up on love like 5 years back. That doesn't bother me too. But in my mind I have an image, okay. A visualization of what could be. But I never want to realise that. It's like a thought jo bas sochne mein achcha lagta hai. So weirdly enough you check a lot of boxes. A lot. But then when you said you were in love I just couldn't figure out how. Like I thought everyone else operates on the same frequency as me so how can anyone find love? But then here you are. And so is Steven Wilson. I am not kidding when I say his marriage was a shock to me. I was so so so confused. Anyway. Last year I tried to be with a girl for the long haul for the first time. I thought everything was just my mind's creation and I am not fucked. But during that relationship I found out my worst fear. Everything was true man. I am fucked. I am happy when I am engrossed in work but every now and then I slip and it's so dark. I again strayed away. Anyway, so when you told me something about your bf this evening it kinda triggered a lot of things. And please don't blame yourself. Triggers aren't avoidable. So I thought maybe I am sad because I can't be with her. You know, the woman of my dreams whom you resemble so much. So I asked myself that if we're together, you and I kal ko, how would I feel. And I thought that no that doesn't make me content either. it's not being with you that I desire. But it's got to do something with you. I think so. I don't know. And it's such a joke. Because you know rn you could as well be a character out of a random book and not a human. And I think that's fucked. That I can't find happiness and contentment within myself bothers me.
15/03/20, 1:02 am - Tamal: I already feel better.
15/03/20, 1:02 am - Tamal: Wow.
15/03/20, 1:04 am - Tamal: I am so sorry dude.
15/03/20, 1:04 am - Vedika: The thing is you know. Everyone seems perfect from a distance.
15/03/20, 1:04 am - Tamal: It must be so weird for you.
15/03/20, 1:04 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs not easy being with me. Hence why Akash means so much to me. Being content is difficult for all man.
15/03/20, 1:05 am - Tamal: Can I ask you a few personal questions?
15/03/20, 1:05 am - Tamal: That's so so fucked.
15/03/20, 1:05 am - Tamal: But please.
15/03/20, 1:05 am - Tamal: Feel free to dodge them if you want to but atleast just let me
15/03/20, 1:10 am - Tamal: You okay?
15/03/20, 1:15 am - Tamal: Dude. 
 You there?
15/03/20, 1:19 am - Tamal: Dude. You are taking my depression away and giving me anxiety badle mein.
15/03/20, 1:21 am - Tamal: If you've fallen asleep I swear ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
15/03/20, 1:24 am - Vedika: Yes. Ask.
15/03/20, 1:24 am - Vedika: Sorry man. I got sick.
15/03/20, 1:24 am - Tamal: Ugh. I am so selfish.
15/03/20, 1:24 am - Tamal: We will talk about this baad mein.
15/03/20, 1:24 am - Tamal: I am feeling much better.
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Tamal: How are you?
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Vedika: Erre bolo bolo
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Vedika: Medicines le raha tha
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Tamal: Shut up. Did you just throw up?
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Tamal: Oh okay.
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Vedika: Bolo
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Tamal: Trust me I will. Someday else.
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Vedika: Abbey ask nah
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Tamal: Sure toh
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Vedika: Maatha nai kharab karo
15/03/20, 1:25 am - Tamal: You feeling okay?
15/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: Sorry madam
15/03/20, 1:26 am - Vedika: If I don‚Äôt wanna andwer I won‚Äôt nah
15/03/20, 1:26 am - Vedika: Itna darna kya hai
15/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: Okay okay.
15/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: Darr nahi raha. You're sick and all isiliye
15/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: Anyway
15/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: Have you ever felt that giddiness in your gut?
15/03/20, 1:26 am - Vedika: Giddiness?
15/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: Like not before throwing up but while in love?
15/03/20, 1:27 am - Vedika: Yeah
15/03/20, 1:27 am - Tamal: Yeah. Like whatever they say. Butterflies and all
15/03/20, 1:27 am - Vedika: But that was like.
15/03/20, 1:27 am - Vedika: Not love.
15/03/20, 1:27 am - Tamal: Sexüòå
15/03/20, 1:27 am - Vedika: Love needs to be peaceful for me.
15/03/20, 1:27 am - Tamal: Explain.
15/03/20, 1:28 am - Vedika: My heart shouldn‚Äôt beat faster when they‚Äôre there but It should beat slower and calm down when I see them.
15/03/20, 1:28 am - Vedika: My muscles should relax
15/03/20, 1:28 am - Vedika: My eyes feel hydrated
15/03/20, 1:28 am - Vedika: Easier to breathe
15/03/20, 1:29 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt want shortness of breath. That‚Äôs surface level love.
15/03/20, 1:29 am - Tamal: This is going to happen anyway. Do you think people's hearts beat faster when theyre in a  3+yr relationship
15/03/20, 1:29 am - Tamal: Of course it doesn't. You become used to it.
15/03/20, 1:29 am - Tamal: But okay. I get the gist.
15/03/20, 1:29 am - Tamal: Moving on.
15/03/20, 1:30 am - Tamal: Kal ko if he's dying would you trade your life for him?
15/03/20, 1:30 am - Vedika: No
15/03/20, 1:30 am - Vedika: That‚Äôs not what I mean
15/03/20, 1:30 am - Vedika: And it does. Moments of lust make you feel that.
15/03/20, 1:30 am - Vedika: Of course.
15/03/20, 1:31 am - Tamal: Tch. Lust ke alawa. There are couples that are together for God knows how long. 10 yrs. 20 yrs. Lust kab tak rahega bro
15/03/20, 1:31 am - Tamal: This. I don't get this. Why?
15/03/20, 1:31 am - Vedika: Rehta hai dude.
15/03/20, 1:31 am - Tamal: Ok boomer.
15/03/20, 1:32 am - Tamal: Lol look at me asking for help 20 mins before and giving you a piece of mind rn üòÇ
15/03/20, 1:32 am - Vedika: Jitna tu sceptical hai abhi
15/03/20, 1:32 am - Vedika: Uska about ten times I had been all my life before I met alash.
15/03/20, 1:32 am - Vedika: *akash
15/03/20, 1:33 am - Tamal: All this is fake. Everyone's gonna die. Nothing matters.
15/03/20, 1:33 am - Vedika: Because he‚Äôs a beautiful person. And he matters to me.
15/03/20, 1:33 am - Vedika: So what?
15/03/20, 1:33 am - Vedika: That‚Äôs a fucking excuse.
15/03/20, 1:33 am - Tamal: Nobody exists on purpose. Everyone's gonna die. Come watch TV
15/03/20, 1:33 am - Vedika: Why even watch rick and morty
15/03/20, 1:33 am - Vedika: Nothing matters right
15/03/20, 1:33 am - Tamal: Arre. Toh in either case you don't get to be with him. Why trade lives?
15/03/20, 1:34 am - Vedika: Why don‚Äôt you go into a coma till you die
15/03/20, 1:34 am - Tamal: Oh. Don't lure me.
15/03/20, 1:34 am - Vedika: Love isn‚Äôt about being with someone
15/03/20, 1:34 am - Tamal: Fuck that
15/03/20, 1:34 am - Tamal: Uhuh
15/03/20, 1:34 am - Tamal: No really
15/03/20, 1:34 am - Tamal: Fuck that
15/03/20, 1:34 am - Tamal: Where do you live in?
15/03/20, 1:34 am - Tamal: Fucking Himalayas
15/03/20, 1:34 am - Vedika: Yes
15/03/20, 1:35 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm too detached from society dude
15/03/20, 1:35 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt get this culture
15/03/20, 1:35 am - Tamal: Nahi nahi. Ab bata wo.
15/03/20, 1:35 am - Tamal: That statement you made basically means you can love anyone.
15/03/20, 1:35 am - Vedika: Which statement?
15/03/20, 1:35 am - Vedika: No I can‚Äôt.
15/03/20, 1:35 am - Tamal: .
15/03/20, 1:36 am - Vedika: I legit hate everyone
15/03/20, 1:36 am - Tamal: That's why I love you bro
15/03/20, 1:36 am - Vedika: Yeah. Love isn‚Äôt ki oh I have to stay with Akash
15/03/20, 1:36 am - Tamal: Kal ko I can be in love with Kylie Jenner?
15/03/20, 1:36 am - Vedika: Even if I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôll love him. And be with him.
15/03/20, 1:36 am - Vedika: Sure why not
15/03/20, 1:36 am - Tamal: Okay okay.
15/03/20, 1:36 am - Vedika: Koi roka hai?
15/03/20, 1:37 am - Tamal: Just keep answering my short questions.
15/03/20, 1:37 am - Tamal: People change. Agreed?
15/03/20, 1:37 am - Vedika: As long as you‚Äôre not harassing her or crossing any lines
15/03/20, 1:37 am - Vedika: Depends
15/03/20, 1:37 am - Tamal: Eh.
15/03/20, 1:37 am - Tamal: Why can't you ever say a yes or a no
15/03/20, 1:37 am - Tamal: Except when you say 'yeah no'
15/03/20, 1:38 am - Vedika: Because it‚Äôs not black or white
15/03/20, 1:38 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs and
15/03/20, 1:38 am - Tamal: Dimaag ka check up kara tu ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
15/03/20, 1:38 am - Tamal: Sometimes it is. Sometimes
15/03/20, 1:38 am - Tamal: Tu humesha gray zone mein rehti hai
15/03/20, 1:39 am - Vedika: Yes man
15/03/20, 1:39 am - Vedika: Always
15/03/20, 1:39 am - Tamal: See. I agree you have a different outlook on love and I accept that. Infact it's a very ideal one.
15/03/20, 1:39 am - Vedika: Buddhism is the middle path
15/03/20, 1:39 am - Tamal: But log waise nahi hote na
15/03/20, 1:39 am - Tamal: The people you love they have to see that pov of yours too na
15/03/20, 1:39 am - Vedika: I am. My love is. Aur ghanta farq padhta hai mereko
15/03/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: Aaj kal love has become a joke
15/03/20, 1:40 am - Tamal: That's a lie. Let time come.
15/03/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: And I‚Äôm not here for it
15/03/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: Don‚Äôt tell me what my life is
15/03/20, 1:40 am - Tamal: Nonsense bhai. Bazaaro mein bikta hai.
15/03/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: Deal with yoir own instead of taking mine down.
15/03/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt think I should talk to you.
15/03/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: This is toxic.
15/03/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: I agree. I can be a bit toxic at times.
15/03/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: But it's only to see ki uss side kuch hai ya nahi
15/03/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: I am not like this all the time
15/03/20, 1:41 am - Vedika: Seems like you wanna ruin my relationship and I don‚Äôt have people like this in my life.
15/03/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: Okay.
15/03/20, 1:42 am - Tamal: 1. Calm down
15/03/20, 1:42 am - Tamal: 2. I am sorry
15/03/20, 1:42 am - Vedika: Sorry isn‚Äôt gonna make it okay.
15/03/20, 1:42 am - Tamal: 3. Be happy with whoever you want to.
15/03/20, 1:42 am - Vedika: Stop being selfish.
15/03/20, 1:42 am - Tamal: I know why you see it like that
15/03/20, 1:42 am - Vedika: Stop projecting your issues onto others.
15/03/20, 1:42 am - Vedika: You can‚Äôt handle love, not my problem.
15/03/20, 1:43 am - Vedika: But you can‚Äôt tell others they can‚Äôt handle it either
15/03/20, 1:43 am - Tamal: Ek baar sunn le what I am saying.
15/03/20, 1:43 am - Tamal: You're pissed and it's justified
15/03/20, 1:43 am - Vedika: Don‚Äôt judge something you‚Äôve not had.
15/03/20, 1:43 am - Vedika: Look man.
15/03/20, 1:44 am - Tamal: Please. I know why you're mad. I know I am in the wrong.
15/03/20, 1:44 am - Tamal: Ek baar let me explain
15/03/20, 1:44 am - Tamal: Okay?
15/03/20, 1:45 am - Vedika: I was only talking to you right now cause I thought you needed someone to talk to.
15/03/20, 1:45 am - Vedika: Akash is number one in my life. Rest are mere pawns.
15/03/20, 1:45 am - Tamal: Ek baar bolne degi? Please
15/03/20, 1:46 am - Tamal: Dude. You've priorities in your life. Nothing I say can change that. Maine subah bhi bola tha don't change your life rules for me.
15/03/20, 1:46 am - Tamal: You don't have to.
15/03/20, 1:46 am - Tamal: I put counter arguments. Because that's how I make decisions
15/03/20, 1:47 am - Tamal: I don't do that to jeopardize whatever you got.
15/03/20, 1:47 am - Tamal: It's like at the end I would see that your/my logic makes sense and accept that
15/03/20, 1:47 am - Tamal: That's my only purpose.
15/03/20, 1:47 am - Tamal: I would hate myself if I do that with anyone.
15/03/20, 1:48 am - Vedika: Man. Shut up rn.
15/03/20, 1:48 am - Tamal: Idk what else to say.
15/03/20, 1:48 am - Tamal: I swear on everything holy that that was only purpose.

15/03/20, 1:49 am - Tamal: Bottomline. Sorry.
15/03/20, 1:51 am - Tamal: This is not a light allegation. I have a conscience. If I talk to you after this am I a man? 
Stay happy dude. Stay happy.
15/03/20, 1:53 am - Vedika: Who the fuck are you say that to someone you don‚Äôt even know.
15/03/20, 1:55 am - Tamal: Dude. I do this all the time

15/03/20, 1:57 am - Tamal: Sorry.
15/03/20, 1:57 am - Tamal: That's a strong allegation dude. Think of it when you calm down.

15/03/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: Okay. If there was one person I wouldn't demean it would be you.
15/03/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: Do whatever the fuck you want to with that information
15/03/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: I respect your opinions a lot.
15/03/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: Ainvayi koi baithh ke Upanishad nahi padhta
15/03/20, 2:01 am - Tamal: I value your perspective
15/03/20, 2:01 am - Tamal: Isiliye I talk to you.
15/03/20, 2:01 am - Vedika: This doesn‚Äôt seem sincere to me
15/03/20, 2:01 am - Tamal: But you think I am trying to ruin your relationship and call your life a lie?
15/03/20, 2:01 am - Vedika: There‚Äôs my perspective
15/03/20, 2:01 am - Tamal: You're going after one text. Seriously? One text.
15/03/20, 2:02 am - Vedika: Yes I am.
15/03/20, 2:02 am - Tamal: And that determines my character?
15/03/20, 2:02 am - Tamal: Thanks.
15/03/20, 2:02 am - Vedika: No. But in the moment. Yes.
15/03/20, 2:02 am - Vedika: You made a snap judgment out of a negative emotion.
15/03/20, 2:02 am - Tamal: I am really not that sensitive. But you hurt me man.
15/03/20, 2:02 am - Vedika: That does say a lot.
15/03/20, 2:02 am - Tamal: Okay
15/03/20, 2:02 am - Vedika: I did the same and you couldn‚Äôt handle it
15/03/20, 2:02 am - Vedika: There you go
15/03/20, 2:03 am - Tamal: When?
15/03/20, 2:03 am - Tamal: Dude. Fuck.

15/03/20, 2:03 am - Tamal: I never meant any harm
15/03/20, 2:03 am - Tamal: Idk why you think I did.
15/03/20, 2:04 am - Tamal: But your judgment matters.
15/03/20, 2:04 am - Tamal: So be it.
15/03/20, 2:04 am - Vedika: Like I said.
15/03/20, 2:04 am - Vedika: That wasn‚Äôt sincere.
15/03/20, 2:04 am - Vedika: You‚Äôve been sincere till now.
15/03/20, 2:04 am - Tamal: I say a lot of shit.
15/03/20, 2:05 am - Tamal: I can see why you're pissed
15/03/20, 2:05 am - Tamal: I agreed with you then and there
15/03/20, 2:05 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm not just pissed.
15/03/20, 2:05 am - Tamal: This I can't get out of my head.
15/03/20, 2:05 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm shocked at how much you think you have a say in my life??????
15/03/20, 2:05 am - Tamal: I domt
15/03/20, 2:05 am - Tamal: Fuck you think
15/03/20, 2:05 am - Tamal: I was just making a dumb argument
15/03/20, 2:06 am - Tamal: I thought you'd agree or diagree
15/03/20, 2:06 am - Tamal: I didn't expect you to go ballistic.
15/03/20, 2:06 am - Tamal: Did I not talk crap about anything else till now
15/03/20, 2:06 am - Tamal: That you thought I must be taken by my exact words.
15/03/20, 2:06 am - Vedika: Look man
15/03/20, 2:06 am - Vedika: All these are excuses
15/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm not going ballistic
15/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: There‚Äôs a line
15/03/20, 2:07 am - Tamal: And I crossed it?
15/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: yeah by telling me it‚Äôs a lie.
15/03/20, 2:07 am - Tamal: Fair enough. Cut me off
15/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: Do you even know what ‚Äòit‚Äô is
15/03/20, 2:08 am - Vedika: that you so easily called a lie
15/03/20, 2:08 am - Tamal: I wish I could show you the time I took to text that.
15/03/20, 2:08 am - Tamal: You deleted this message
15/03/20, 2:08 am - Vedika: and if you blame me for going ‚Äúballistic‚Äù. Then I‚Äôll have to.
15/03/20, 2:09 am - Vedika: :)
15/03/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: Go on. I wouldn't like to 'ruin' a person's life I so deeply appreciate.
15/03/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: You're nice and beautiful in your ways.
15/03/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: You deleted this message
15/03/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: I don't think about stuff before saying.
15/03/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: And that's kinda below your standards
15/03/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: Fair enough
15/03/20, 2:10 am - Tamal: Bye bye
15/03/20, 2:10 am - Vedika: I did the same thing you did. And look at you. I didn‚Äôt think before saying that and you can‚Äôt handle it. Can you.
15/03/20, 2:11 am - Vedika: You can not call something a lie just because it didn‚Äôt work out for you.
15/03/20, 2:11 am - Tamal: I can. If it's a small thing. Like one moment. You went on a rant. That isn't a slip up
15/03/20, 2:12 am - Tamal: [15/03, 1:40 AM] +91 6290 402 886: Deal with yoir own instead of taking mine down.
[15/03, 1:40 AM] +91 6290 402 886: This is toxic.
[15/03, 1:41 AM] +91 6290 402 886: Seems like you wanna ruin my relationship and I don‚Äôt have people like this in my life.
[15/03, 1:42 AM] +91 6290 402 886: Stop being selfish.
[15/03, 1:42 AM] +91 6290 402 886: Stop projecting your issues onto others.
[15/03, 1:42 AM] +91 6290 402 886: You can‚Äôt handle love, not my problem.
[15/03, 1:43 AM] +91 6290 402 886: But you can‚Äôt tell others they can‚Äôt handle it either
15/03/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: :)
15/03/20, 2:12 am - Tamal: This vs.
15/03/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: vs?
15/03/20, 2:13 am - Tamal: This
15/03/20, 2:13 am - Tamal: Who do you think thought of hurting the other?
15/03/20, 2:13 am - Vedika: if you thought it won‚Äôt you‚Äôre an idiot
15/03/20, 2:13 am - Vedika: Go take a class on empathy
15/03/20, 2:13 am - Tamal: Tu empathy mat bol please
15/03/20, 2:14 am - Tamal: No actually you are empathetic.
15/03/20, 2:14 am - Tamal: You deleted this message
15/03/20, 2:14 am - Tamal: You deleted this message
15/03/20, 2:14 am - Vedika: Why
15/03/20, 2:14 am - Vedika: I wouldn‚Äôt but had to
15/03/20, 2:14 am - Vedika: Good.
15/03/20, 2:15 am - Tamal: You listened to me when I needed you to. I don't forget graciousness.
15/03/20, 2:15 am - Vedika: üôÑ
15/03/20, 2:15 am - Vedika: Ok
15/03/20, 2:15 am - Tamal: But honestly. I can't continue to talk to you. I want to keep a safe distance from ruining anything in your life
15/03/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: See you cant handle it
15/03/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: This is not light. Soch ke dekh
15/03/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: What you said was worse
15/03/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: Tu bhi soch ke dekh bhai
15/03/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: Okay. We have talked about this for some time now right?
15/03/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: It was fucking evil to say that
15/03/20, 2:17 am - Tamal: Look at the no. Of apologies I made vs the no. Of apologies you made. 
You don't have to apologise now. It just shows that I am genuinely sorry and you're not.
15/03/20, 2:17 am - Tamal: You actually meant that didn't you?
15/03/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: You‚Äôve not made apologies.
15/03/20, 2:18 am - Vedika: You‚Äôve said just this.
15/03/20, 2:18 am - Tamal: .
15/03/20, 2:18 am - Vedika: Wow what an apology
15/03/20, 2:18 am - Tamal: You deleted this message
15/03/20, 2:18 am - Tamal: Not this.
15/03/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm not gonna apologise anyway.
15/03/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt attach your personal life without knowing anything about it.
15/03/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt call it a lie.
15/03/20, 2:19 am - Tamal: You deleted this message
15/03/20, 2:19 am - Tamal: The fuck. My WhatsApp's drunk.
15/03/20, 2:20 am - Vedika: *attack
15/03/20, 2:20 am - Vedika: Stop being a baby and learn to deal with shit dude
15/03/20, 2:20 am - Tamal: You called me a dude trying to ruin a relationship
15/03/20, 2:20 am - Tamal: YOUR relationship
15/03/20, 2:21 am - Tamal: I sent a 10 worded text. That I didn't think through. You had enough time.
15/03/20, 2:21 am - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt.
15/03/20, 2:21 am - Vedika: I said what I felt.
15/03/20, 2:21 am - Vedika: You said what you felt.
15/03/20, 2:21 am - Tamal: You stand by it?
15/03/20, 2:21 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm not apologising for what I said. I didn‚Äôt cross a line.
15/03/20, 2:22 am - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt do this.
15/03/20, 2:22 am - Tamal: Yes or no.
15/03/20, 2:22 am - Tamal: I am sorry 
I don't stand by it. 
It was a mistake
15/03/20, 2:22 am - Vedika: I need to know what it meant.
15/03/20, 2:22 am - Tamal: It meant shit. Like my pop song reference
15/03/20, 2:22 am - Tamal: Tab you didn't try to decode much
15/03/20, 2:23 am - Tamal: Why?
15/03/20, 2:23 am - Vedika: Because it wasn‚Äôt a personal topic.
15/03/20, 2:23 am - Vedika: See what I said right before that. Do you still not get it?
15/03/20, 2:23 am - Tamal: Chhor.
15/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: You still think I am a creep.
15/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: Probably I am too
15/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: Jaane de.
15/03/20, 2:24 am - Vedika: See what you replied to.
15/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: Go.
15/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: I can't man.
15/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: You made up your mind
15/03/20, 2:24 am - Vedika: If you don‚Äôt even make an effort to understand
15/03/20, 2:24 am - Vedika: That‚Äôs it then
15/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: I had a good time talking to you. I swear I did.
15/03/20, 2:25 am - Tamal: Sorry for whatever douchebaggery I did.
15/03/20, 2:25 am - Tamal: I didn't mean any
15/03/20, 2:25 am - Tamal: Yeah. Take care of yourself.
15/03/20, 2:25 am - Tamal: Don't spread that shit here :3
15/03/20, 2:25 am - Tamal: Night night.
15/03/20, 2:50 am - Tamal: Last last. Thanks for being there for me. I really really appreciate that. Writing to you calmed me down. So thanks for that.
15/03/20, 3:00 am - Vedika: :)
15/03/20, 8:15 pm - Tamal: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Kal I crossed a line unintentionally and it hurt you and you said stuff and all that. That's done. I apologised. I told you I didn't mean that. I just need to know for the peace of my mind whether you meant what you said. That I tried creating a riff between you guys? Did I? Say yes if that's the truth. I am not a pussy. I can take that. Good talk. Ugh.
15/03/20, 8:15 pm - Vedika: chill
15/03/20, 8:15 pm - Vedika: It‚Äôs over

15/03/20, 8:15 pm - Tamal: It's just a yes or a no man. Just say it.
15/03/20, 8:16 pm - Tamal: I may have unintentionally done that idk

15/03/20, 8:16 pm - Vedika: in the moment, yes. 
But in the long run, nooh.

15/03/20, 8:16 pm - Vedika: now that‚Äôs it.

15/03/20, 8:17 pm - Vedika: I‚Äôm the avocado in case u didn‚Äôt notice
15/03/20, 8:19 pm - Tamal: Fuck arguments. I thought I lost you. I felt like crap.
15/03/20, 8:20 pm - Tamal: And dude most of the times I know when I am going off limits. Kal I was in a bad place and said something that I didn't mean.
15/03/20, 8:20 pm - Tamal: Promise me in the future if I say something harsh you confirm with me once whether I really mean it or not. In most cases I won't.
15/03/20, 8:20 pm - Tamal: Because I am a really nice guu
15/03/20, 8:20 pm - Tamal: *guy
15/03/20, 8:21 pm - Tamal: <Media omitted>

15/03/20, 8:27 pm - Vedika: True.

15/03/20, 8:27 pm - Vedika: s e e m

15/03/20, 8:58 pm - Vedika: But anyone else
15/03/20, 8:58 pm - Vedika: Yes
15/03/20, 8:58 pm - Vedika: Exactly

15/03/20, 9:02 pm - Tamal: I understand man
15/03/20, 9:02 pm - Vedika: Her eyes were hollowed out. Pitch black.
15/03/20, 9:02 pm - Vedika: Froze to death
15/03/20, 9:02 pm - Tamal: But how. She lived with you guys na
15/03/20, 9:02 pm - Vedika: That day was very supernatural for me
15/03/20, 9:03 pm - Vedika: No. She was a street cat.
15/03/20, 9:03 pm - Vedika: That‚Äôs why she was a lot more special.
15/03/20, 9:03 pm - Vedika: She always came for me.
15/03/20, 9:03 pm - Tamal: Oh. I get it.
15/03/20, 9:03 pm - Vedika: She stayed here for me
15/03/20, 9:03 pm - Tamal: Yes
15/03/20, 9:03 pm - Tamal: Like how my canteen cat chose me
15/03/20, 9:03 pm - Tamal: Want to see her?
15/03/20, 9:03 pm - Vedika: show
15/03/20, 9:04 pm - Tamal: <Media omitted>
15/03/20, 9:04 pm - Tamal: She greeted me everytime I went to my college canteen
15/03/20, 9:05 pm - Tamal: And that day I went after graduating to collect my degree after 6 months. And she greeted me the same
15/03/20, 9:05 pm - Vedika: Fuck she looks similar
15/03/20, 9:05 pm - Vedika: I stayed with her all day man
15/03/20, 9:05 pm - Vedika: She just would lay on my lap and sleep and purrrrrrr
15/03/20, 9:05 pm - Tamal: I feel you dude. It hurts.
15/03/20, 9:05 pm - Vedika: And I would just feel okay
15/03/20, 9:06 pm - Vedika: She saved my life.
15/03/20, 9:06 pm - Vedika: Many times.
15/03/20, 9:06 pm - Tamal: Yeah. üòÇ They fucking vibrate when they're peaceful.
15/03/20, 9:06 pm - Tamal: God.
15/03/20, 9:06 pm - Vedika: They do.
15/03/20, 9:06 pm - Vedika: Man. Now I just don‚Äôt feel the same love for cats.
15/03/20, 9:07 pm - Vedika: I just feel like yeah I love them. But I don‚Äôt indulge anymore as much.
15/03/20, 9:07 pm - Vedika: cause I just hate it. it‚Äôs not her.
15/03/20, 9:07 pm - Vedika: Idk. I‚Äôm too loyal.
15/03/20, 9:07 pm - Tamal: See. How I look at it is this. All cats are one single unit. They're not aloof. So a cat senses if someone is a cat person. This cat I showed won't come near many dudes.
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Vedika: Yes. I know.
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Tamal: It's her only dude. Just her in a different body.
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Vedika: Cats love me.
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Vedika: No man.
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Vedika: Idk.
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Vedika: I just can‚Äôt
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Tamal: Yes. They understand
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Tamal: I will introduce you to one.üòå
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Tamal: You can't say no
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Vedika: She was there for me. She was the one.
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Vedika: I would never
15/03/20, 9:08 pm - Vedika: I just might not enjoy as much as I used to
15/03/20, 9:09 pm - Tamal: It would need time sure.
15/03/20, 9:09 pm - Tamal: But don't shut that option down completely please
15/03/20, 9:09 pm - Vedika: It‚Äôs been four months.
15/03/20, 9:09 pm - Vedika: I‚Äôm not
15/03/20, 9:09 pm - Vedika: I‚Äôm still shook about it.
15/03/20, 9:09 pm - Vedika: I haven‚Äôt processed it.
15/03/20, 9:10 pm - Tamal: This reminded me
15/03/20, 9:10 pm - Tamal: I saw a cat in my neighborhood today
15/03/20, 9:10 pm - Vedika: Man. I think she was the love of my life.
15/03/20, 9:10 pm - Tamal: With her leg broken
15/03/20, 9:10 pm - Vedika: Don‚Äôt tell me
15/03/20, 9:11 pm - Vedika: I don‚Äôt like animals hurt
15/03/20, 9:11 pm - Vedika: Any animal is hurt and I feel it
15/03/20, 9:11 pm - Tamal: She was. But see life is weird man. I don't really know how true is the ek darwaaza band hota hai toh... Logic but I am sure you will find love in you to give to others too
15/03/20, 9:11 pm - Vedika: I have a legit pain in my right leg for some reason now
15/03/20, 9:11 pm - Tamal: You're a üêà
15/03/20, 9:11 pm - Vedika: Bhak bc. That‚Äôs not the point.
15/03/20, 9:12 pm - Tamal: Idk why I always assume someone's hurt them. Because cats are so fucking smart. They rarely get hurt on their own.
15/03/20, 9:12 pm - Tamal: I despise humans.
15/03/20, 9:13 pm - Vedika: Jese yaar. Ek hota hai pyaar. Bas. Ek hoti hai nah jisko bas nahi bhula paoge humesha pyaar karoge hi. Like a huge chunk of you will be hers forever. Like sure you still like girls. But that one girl is it. Like the one. 
That‚Äôs her for me, in cats.
15/03/20, 9:14 pm - Tamal: I don't think people are like that. I think life is all about moving.
15/03/20, 9:14 pm - Tamal: All the time.
15/03/20, 9:14 pm - Tamal: Koi mile saath toh it's brilliant
15/03/20, 9:14 pm - Vedika: Dude. I used to stare at everyone and scare them away from her.
15/03/20, 9:14 pm - Tamal: But you have to keep moving anyway
15/03/20, 9:14 pm - Vedika: Move karna kaun mana kiya hai
15/03/20, 9:14 pm - Vedika: Doesn‚Äôt mean u stop loving
15/03/20, 9:14 pm - Tamal: Haan. You love her. There's no changing that.
15/03/20, 9:14 pm - Vedika: I could never stop loving her. Or anyone I love.
15/03/20, 9:15 pm - Tamal: But you keep moving (aka petting others and letting them close)
15/03/20, 9:15 pm - Vedika: but it‚Äôs not as enjoyable as it was with her
15/03/20, 9:15 pm - Vedika: Never will be as special
15/03/20, 9:15 pm - Vedika: Is special sure
15/03/20, 9:15 pm - Vedika: But if I had a choice. It‚Äôs her.
15/03/20, 9:15 pm - Tamal: You don't toh.
15/03/20, 9:15 pm - Tamal: That's the reality
15/03/20, 9:15 pm - Vedika: A thousand cats forever or her back for a day?
15/03/20, 9:15 pm - Tamal: Just try
15/03/20, 9:16 pm - Vedika: Her back for a day
15/03/20, 9:16 pm - Vedika: Love is reality man
15/03/20, 9:16 pm - Vedika: As long as I love her. She‚Äôs with me.
15/03/20, 9:16 pm - Vedika: As long as I remember her. She‚Äôs with me.
15/03/20, 9:17 pm - Tamal: If you don't have the need for a physical persona then more power to you dude.
15/03/20, 9:17 pm - Vedika: I‚Äôll be practical in all aspects in life
15/03/20, 9:17 pm - Vedika: Not when it comes to love
15/03/20, 9:17 pm - Vedika: Well u can see that
15/03/20, 9:17 pm - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt have it for the longest time. When I got it. I realised what it really is.
15/03/20, 9:18 pm - Tamal: Umm. I think I am in danger here. Let's change the topic. Because that's one topic you're very sensitive in and we have very different views on that
15/03/20, 9:18 pm - Vedika: I had the same views
15/03/20, 9:19 pm - Vedika: just need to get love from one being
15/03/20, 9:19 pm - Tamal: Glad you did
15/03/20, 9:19 pm - Vedika: And trust me. It‚Äôll change your outlook on everything
15/03/20, 9:19 pm - Tamal: I don't want it.
15/03/20, 9:19 pm - Tamal: Kaise samjhaun
15/03/20, 9:19 pm - Vedika: yeh I can see my 14 year old self
15/03/20, 9:19 pm - Vedika: Theek theek
15/03/20, 9:19 pm - Tamal: I am fully functional now right?
15/03/20, 9:19 pm - Vedika: You‚Äôre afraid you‚Äôll get dependent
15/03/20, 9:20 pm - Tamal: Eh. Now you're being condescending
15/03/20, 9:20 pm - Vedika: You‚Äôre afraid you‚Äôll need it constantly
15/03/20, 9:20 pm - Vedika: No I‚Äôm serious
15/03/20, 9:20 pm - Vedika: I get it
15/03/20, 9:20 pm - Tamal: No no. Sunn mera perspective
15/03/20, 9:20 pm - Vedika: Boliye
15/03/20, 9:21 pm - Tamal: I think I love certain aspects of 'love'. But I can't cherry pick right. The other aspects I find toxic. So I will let that entire dish slide down my menu, thanks.
15/03/20, 9:21 pm - Tamal: Makes sense?
15/03/20, 9:21 pm - Vedika: What‚Äôs the toxic part?
15/03/20, 9:21 pm - Tamal: It's tough to explain
15/03/20, 9:22 pm - Vedika: Love in what sense?
15/03/20, 9:22 pm - Tamal: For me it's someone existing between me and my work
15/03/20, 9:22 pm - Tamal: If I work and think about someone else, I hate that
15/03/20, 9:22 pm - Tamal: I will somehow kill the entire thing off.
15/03/20, 9:22 pm - Tamal: Work's holy to me
15/03/20, 9:23 pm - Vedika: Me too.
15/03/20, 9:23 pm - Vedika: Toh?
15/03/20, 9:23 pm - Tamal: There is difference.
15/03/20, 9:23 pm - Vedika: Who said is work or love. Please stop watching bullshit tv shows.
15/03/20, 9:23 pm - Tamal: Love inspires you.
15/03/20, 9:23 pm - Vedika: *its
15/03/20, 9:23 pm - Tamal: Love tires me
15/03/20, 9:23 pm - Vedika: No.
15/03/20, 9:23 pm - Vedika: Work inspires me.
15/03/20, 9:23 pm - Vedika: Loves makes it worth it.
15/03/20, 9:24 pm - Vedika: You love work.
15/03/20, 9:24 pm - Tamal: Okay I will take your word for it then.
15/03/20, 9:24 pm - Vedika: Don‚Äôt you see that?
15/03/20, 9:24 pm - Vedika: Love isn‚Äôt a person, tamal.
15/03/20, 9:24 pm - Vedika: It‚Äôs an emotion.
15/03/20, 9:24 pm - Tamal: I don't do that for love. I do it because it has to be done. There's ruthlessness in that
15/03/20, 9:24 pm - Tamal: A tiger doesn't love hunting
15/03/20, 9:24 pm - Tamal: It hunts coz it's got to
15/03/20, 9:24 pm - Vedika: LOL
15/03/20, 9:24 pm - Tamal: Kinda that stuff
15/03/20, 9:25 pm - Vedika: a tiger enjoys the chase
15/03/20, 9:25 pm - Vedika: Itna planning karne ka zaroorat nahi hai usko
15/03/20, 9:25 pm - Tamal: Na re bhai. If they aren't hungry they won't move a muscle
15/03/20, 9:25 pm - Vedika: Look. Love isn‚Äôt toxic.
15/03/20, 9:25 pm - Vedika: Legit the only shit that isn‚Äôt.
15/03/20, 9:25 pm - Vedika: Emotions related to it are.
15/03/20, 9:26 pm - Vedika: Like being jelly or insecurity or uncertainty whatever
15/03/20, 9:26 pm - Vedika: Love is always pure.
15/03/20, 9:26 pm - Tamal: Dekh dekh. You can tell me everything about it. It all might be true. Maybe it is. But I won't appreciate it if I don't feel it right? You can tell me but you can't make me feel it right.
15/03/20, 9:26 pm - Tamal: [15/03, 9:25 PM] Vedika: Look. Love isn‚Äôt toxic.
[15/03, 9:25 PM] Vedika: Legit the only shit that isn‚Äôt.
[15/03, 9:25 PM] Vedika: Emotions related to it are.
[15/03, 9:26 PM] Vedika: Like being jelly or insecurity or uncertainty whatever
[15/03, 9:26 PM] Vedika: Love is always pure.
15/03/20, 9:27 pm - Tamal: You're an idealist of the highest pedigree. I appreciate that
15/03/20, 9:27 pm - Vedika: Okay. If you wanna stay less woke, upto you
15/03/20, 9:27 pm - Vedika: It‚Äôs not idealism.
15/03/20, 9:27 pm - Vedika: Love ain‚Äôt idealism
15/03/20, 9:27 pm - Vedika: Trust meeeee
15/03/20, 9:27 pm - Tamal: Hey as you said last night. My reality mine. Your reality yours.
15/03/20, 9:27 pm - Vedika: I used to think that
15/03/20, 9:27 pm - Vedika: If your reality can be better why not choose that but ok
15/03/20, 9:27 pm - Vedika: Comfort zones
15/03/20, 9:27 pm - Vedika: I geddit
15/03/20, 9:28 pm - Tamal: Can I say something without you getting angry
15/03/20, 9:28 pm - Vedika: Bolo
15/03/20, 9:28 pm - Vedika: We‚Äôll see
15/03/20, 9:28 pm - Tamal: Promise?

15/03/20, 9:28 pm - Vedika: Bol
15/03/20, 9:28 pm - Tamal: Don't get mad
15/03/20, 9:28 pm - Tamal: I am just making an argument
15/03/20, 9:28 pm - Tamal: Okay?
15/03/20, 9:29 pm - Vedika: .
15/03/20, 9:29 pm - Tamal: You said na that you used to have the same outlook as mine before you found something special. 
Now my point is just because you switched boats doesn't make the other boat a good choice inherently. It depends ki kisko kya pasand hai and kiska kya destination hai.
15/03/20, 9:30 pm - Vedika: Absolutely.
15/03/20, 9:31 pm - Vedika: But wouldn‚Äôt you like a comfortable cuddley boat that‚Äôs nurtures you rather than a wobbly one which could break any moment.
15/03/20, 9:31 pm - Tamal: Maybe I am a Viking who doesn't like things the easy way :3
15/03/20, 9:32 pm - Vedika: GOD THIS WAS ME
15/03/20, 9:32 pm - Vedika: but ok
15/03/20, 9:32 pm - Vedika: I get your point
15/03/20, 9:32 pm - Tamal: I appreciate you getting my point üòÇ
15/03/20, 9:32 pm - Vedika: All I‚Äôm saying is. I got into spirituality and it changed my perspective.
15/03/20, 9:32 pm - Vedika: Seeing love. Fuck receiving. Just appreciating love, got me love.
15/03/20, 9:32 pm - Vedika: Apne aap.
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Tamal: Hey. I appreciate love pata hai.
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Tamal: I just don't want it for me
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Tamal: I know it's weird
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Vedika: that‚Äôs dumb if I‚Äôm being honest
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Vedika: Been there
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Tamal: Dekh dekh.
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Vedika: I was stoopid too
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Vedika: It‚Äôs ok
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Tamal: Hey
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Tamal: Not cool
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Vedika: Maybe you‚Äôve thought it out
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Tamal: Haan sunn.
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Vedika: Boloooo
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Tamal: It's like Harry Potter.
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Vedika: I hate Harry Potter
15/03/20, 9:33 pm - Vedika: I‚Äôm out
15/03/20, 9:34 pm - Vedika: Theek hai love ko maaro goli tum
15/03/20, 9:34 pm - Tamal: Avada Kedavra üåöüåöüåö
15/03/20, 9:34 pm - Vedika: I hate it
15/03/20, 9:34 pm - Tamal: Hate is not a good word
15/03/20, 9:34 pm - Vedika: I don‚Äôt care
15/03/20, 9:34 pm - Tamal: A spiritual person like you shouldn't use that
15/03/20, 9:34 pm - Vedika: I fucking despise Harry Potter
15/03/20, 9:34 pm - Vedika: I‚Äôm done
15/03/20, 9:34 pm - Vedika: But not that spiritual yet
15/03/20, 9:35 pm - Tamal: Veds on meds isn't a good Veds after all it seems üòå
15/03/20, 9:35 pm - Vedika: I‚Äôm not a hippie. I‚Äôm spiritual
15/03/20, 9:35 pm - Tamal: You're whatever you think you are.
15/03/20, 9:35 pm - Vedika: Stop confusing hippies with spirituality
15/03/20, 9:35 pm - Tamal: Stop thinking that your view is one sole view
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Tamal: And that there's only one way to look at stuff
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Vedika: sure it‚Äôs not
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Vedika: Mere liye toh hai Phil haal
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Vedika: But yes
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Tamal: So my view isn't wrong. It's just different
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Vedika: Hippies and spirituality not the same
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Vedika: I‚Äôm right
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Tamal: Yes you are.
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Tamal: So am I.
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Vedika: Kab bola it‚Äôs wrong oof
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Tamal: I feel we don't actually hate anything.
15/03/20, 9:36 pm - Tamal: Here

15/03/20, 9:37 pm - Vedika: And don‚Äôt do that
15/03/20, 9:37 pm - Tamal: Do what?
15/03/20, 9:38 pm - Vedika: Hippies with spirituality
15/03/20, 9:39 pm - Vedika: Spirituality isn‚Äôt the deniability of negative emotions
15/03/20, 9:39 pm - Vedika: Hippies do that
15/03/20, 9:40 pm - Tamal: Ye sab chhor toh.
15/03/20, 9:40 pm - Tamal: When was the last time you admitted you were wrong?

15/03/20, 9:52 pm - Tamal: I argue bas usi ke liye.
15/03/20, 9:52 pm - Tamal: I get no pleasure in winning an argument
15/03/20, 9:52 pm - Tamal: I appreciate your view
15/03/20, 9:53 pm - Vedika: spirituality ka matlab yeh nai hai I will not use the word hate or jealous or whatever

15/03/20, 10:01 pm - Tamal: You seem to have an opinion that interests me.
15/03/20, 10:01 pm - Tamal: I am not saying ki your opinion will win me over. But it intrigues me
15/03/20, 10:02 pm - Vedika: Ok

16/03/20, 12:54 am - Vedika: Its mcq. It‚Äôs like you need multiple players and each player gives a wrong answer to fool the others. If any player chooses your answer you get a point
16/03/20, 12:55 am - Vedika: Basically it‚Äôs bamboozling
16/03/20, 12:55 am - Vedika: I love bamboozling

16/03/20, 12:56 am - Vedika: Like I didn‚Äôt know it was cheating
16/03/20, 12:56 am - Vedika: I play bluff

16/03/20, 12:57 am - Vedika: Of bluff. Usmein chalta hai nah
16/03/20, 12:57 am - Tamal: Lol. My friends do that. I don't. I just go for it üòÇ
16/03/20, 12:57 am - Tamal: Wow. Did I just sum up my life. Hmmm
16/03/20, 12:57 am - Vedika: I mean it‚Äôs second nature for me
16/03/20, 12:58 am - Vedika: Like I wasn‚Äôt thinking of doing it but ho jaata hai
16/03/20, 12:58 am - Vedika: My brain is like patterns!!!!!! Khojooo!!!!!

16/03/20, 1:36 am - Tamal: Each bottle has 1gm marble only. 10 such marbles in 1 Bottle. And 10 such bottles. But in one of those bottles each marble is of 2gm. You get one weighing chance and you have to tell me which bottle has 2gm marbles.

17/03/20, 8:20 pm - Tamal: You suggest. Because main Chainsmokers bol doonga (not actually but get the feel)
17/03/20, 8:21 pm - Vedika: bye

17/03/20, 8:41 pm - Tamal: Dude. Long rant incoming. Brace yourself. 

You're fucking gorgeous. And I am so glad to have whatever you like to call this (friendship? ugh idk) with you. I feel like I want to tell you 'Don't ever change' but I stop at the thought that if you're this, I wonder what you could be. Be yourself. That's the whole of it I guess. Idk why I see my escape in you. You're pretty fucking amazing man. Okay. Rant over.

17/03/20, 9:41 pm - Tamal: I too am not convinced with the logic.
17/03/20, 9:42 pm - Tamal: The day I find out you'd be the first to know
17/03/20, 9:43 pm - Vedika: ...

17/03/20, 9:46 pm - Vedika: It has.
17/03/20, 9:46 pm - Vedika: Can you stop using this phrase with me?
17/03/20, 9:46 pm - Vedika: I‚Äôm not a fan of it anymore.
17/03/20, 9:46 pm - Vedika: I‚Äôm not being mean. Just don‚Äôt like it.
17/03/20, 9:47 pm - Tamal: What did a proper English phrase do to you?
17/03/20, 9:48 pm - Tamal: If you're getting annoyed then it's probably not the phrase. It's probably just me.
17/03/20, 9:48 pm - Vedika: Can‚Äôt answer that.
17/03/20, 9:48 pm - Vedika: It‚Äôs not you. It has history. Don‚Äôt wanna think.

17/03/20, 9:51 pm - Vedika: Now Im annoyed
17/03/20, 9:51 pm - Vedika: As you wish
17/03/20, 9:51 pm - Tamal: I don't want to fuck things up
17/03/20, 9:52 pm - Vedika: :)
17/03/20, 9:52 pm - Tamal: If you promise me that whatever I say won't change our equation I would really like to get something off of my chest
17/03/20, 9:52 pm - Vedika: we‚Äôll see
17/03/20, 9:53 pm - Vedika: honestly don‚Äôt wanna know anymore
17/03/20, 9:53 pm - Tamal: Yeah. I too realised. That's a dumb thing to ask
17/03/20, 9:53 pm - Tamal: I need to. So just lend me an ear
17/03/20, 9:55 pm - Tamal: Sunegi?
17/03/20, 9:55 pm - Vedika: Bol
17/03/20, 9:57 pm - Tamal: Dekh. I don't know you poora. Infact I don't know you. Right? So you can always dismiss my views aise bolke ki 'what the heck do you know about me' and that's okay. I accept that. Having said that I think you're caught. Idk where. But you are. So I see you, you know as a beautiful gliding eagle. To see you get caught in something doesn't exactly give me happiness.
17/03/20, 9:57 pm - Tamal: Idk if I even got my point across but try to read in between lines.
17/03/20, 9:58 pm - Tamal: And yeah don't mind if all this is bs. It probably is and I don't know you at all. So chill.
17/03/20, 10:09 pm - Vedika: Yes. I am.
17/03/20, 10:09 pm - Vedika: I know I am.
17/03/20, 10:09 pm - Tamal: Cool.
17/03/20, 10:09 pm - Tamal: I appreciate you accepting that.
17/03/20, 10:09 pm - Tamal: On a lighter note
17/03/20, 10:09 pm - Vedika: Why won‚Äôt I.
17/03/20, 10:10 pm - Tamal: Because I wouldn't have.
17/03/20, 10:10 pm - Vedika: I don‚Äôt can‚Äôt let it go. The thing. I‚Äôm not stuck. I just don‚Äôt wanna let it go.
17/03/20, 10:10 pm - Tamal: I don't understand why. But I am not going to question about it too.
17/03/20, 10:10 pm - Tamal: Whatever makes you happy
17/03/20, 10:10 pm - Vedika: OH FUCK
17/03/20, 10:10 pm - Tamal: Whatever you want

17/03/20, 10:12 pm - Tamal: So you were talking about that right?
17/03/20, 10:12 pm - Vedika: Betrayal. Lies. From my best friend. She‚Äôs not who I thought she was. Who anyone thought she was.
17/03/20, 10:13 pm - Tamal: If you think she's your best friend how come you describe her like that?
17/03/20, 10:13 pm - Vedika: This. Cat. My cat. But she never had me stuck or felt caught up. She‚Äôs always set me free.
17/03/20, 10:13 pm - Vedika: Because I found things.
17/03/20, 10:13 pm - Vedika: She was.
17/03/20, 10:13 pm - Tamal: Oh

17/03/20, 10:13 pm - Vedika: ok

17/03/20, 10:14 pm - Vedika: Lol. Shit don‚Äôt affect me.
17/03/20, 10:15 pm - Tamal: Why do you try to be like a crab?
17/03/20, 10:15 pm - Tamal: Oh. Shit.
17/03/20, 10:15 pm - Tamal: Let me explain
17/03/20, 10:15 pm - Tamal: Crab as in..
17/03/20, 10:15 pm - Vedika: I just blocked her from everywhere. Job done.
17/03/20, 10:15 pm - Tamal: Crabs have a tough cover
17/03/20, 10:15 pm - Vedika: Like the animal?
17/03/20, 10:15 pm - Tamal: And soft inside

20/03/20, 1:05 am - Tamal: I can attest to that
20/03/20, 1:05 am - Tamal: That's really low of her. Considering how much you value your music.
20/03/20, 1:05 am - Vedika: Not just the music
20/03/20, 1:05 am - Vedika: Bro texts
20/03/20, 1:05 am - Tamal: But wait. I am a Tinder boy too.

20/03/20, 1:12 am - Tamal: So let's give it to him
20/03/20, 1:12 am - Tamal: ?
20/03/20, 1:13 am - Vedika: you do realise my friends know my insta handle
20/03/20, 1:13 am - Tamal: So if you weren't okay why would you converse with me on Insta
20/03/20, 1:13 am - Vedika: It don‚Äôt really matter cause I don‚Äôt reply to any anyway

20/03/20, 1:15 am - Vedika: Dude to be honest
20/03/20, 1:15 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt know right now
20/03/20, 1:15 am - Vedika: There‚Äôs too much going on. I found some shit out about the only chick I put trust in.
20/03/20, 1:16 am - Tamal: Hey I understand. But do I bring anything to your table? Any fucking thing
20/03/20, 1:16 am - Tamal: That's my only question
20/03/20, 1:16 am - Vedika: at this point I don‚Äôt want to replace her anyone or trust anyone
20/03/20, 1:16 am - Vedika: *with anyone
20/03/20, 1:16 am - Tamal: I don't want to be anyone's replacement.
20/03/20, 1:16 am - Vedika: You‚Äôre not
20/03/20, 1:16 am - Vedika: That is why I‚Äôm keeping a dictance
20/03/20, 1:16 am - Vedika: *distance

20/03/20, 1:17 am - Vedika: This is serious
20/03/20, 1:17 am - Tamal: So just let me know if you want me to fuck off.
20/03/20, 1:17 am - Vedika: Yeh I don‚Äôt trust anyone. But you don‚Äôt know I know so you can‚Äôt tell them anyway

20/03/20, 1:18 am - Vedika: Or if u lie to me
20/03/20, 1:18 am - Tamal: That's your only concern?
20/03/20, 1:18 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs a joke
20/03/20, 1:18 am - Vedika: I know my jokes don‚Äôt seem like jokes cause tone nai hai
20/03/20, 1:19 am - Tamal: Okay. Can you do me a favour?
20/03/20, 1:19 am - Vedika: Depends
20/03/20, 1:20 am - Tamal: Please let me know if that's a yes or a no. Because unlike you I see 'friends' as an investment. Like I invested in you so you were there that night when I needed you. Be particular. Please
20/03/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs not a business deal for me
20/03/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: If this is then I can‚Äôt do business deals with emotions man
20/03/20, 1:21 am - Tamal: And honestly both of us know at this point of time if we drop contact you'd feel nothing and I'd maybe have a hard time for a week. But that's it. I can deal with that
20/03/20, 1:21 am - Tamal: Don't hold the blow for later
20/03/20, 1:21 am - Tamal: That's all I am asking for
20/03/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: Man you don‚Äôt wanna stay or wanna stay upto you

20/03/20, 1:22 am - Vedika: Like does care mean?
20/03/20, 1:22 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs not black or white. It‚Äôs and.

21/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: He graciously writes me a recommendation
21/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: But oh wait
21/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: The format is wrong.
21/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: So you gotta call him again
21/03/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: And then he's going to throw shades.

21/03/20, 1:37 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm very lost.
21/03/20, 1:39 am - Tamal: We all are Vedika. Sometimes we just need some time and that's okay. Take yours unapologetically. See you :)

21/03/20, 1:46 am - Vedika: Not mean. Just fucking annoying.
21/03/20, 1:46 am - Vedika: I can‚Äôt be nice to people. They have to think it‚Äôs flirty or I want something?
21/03/20, 1:48 am - Tamal: Dealing with people hasn't been my forte but you get used to it. I guess you just need to make choices.
21/03/20, 1:48 am - Tamal: Choices that helps keep your peace
21/03/20, 1:48 am - Tamal: *hel0
21/03/20, 1:48 am - Tamal: *help
21/03/20, 1:48 am - Vedika: How hard is it to respect that I‚Äôm loyal to my guy and I won‚Äôt do shit.
21/03/20, 1:48 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt like people man.
21/03/20, 1:49 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt
21/03/20, 1:49 am - Tamal: Lay your boundaries.
21/03/20, 1:49 am - Tamal: Clearly.
21/03/20, 1:49 am - Tamal: Distinctly
21/03/20, 1:49 am - Vedika: I did man
21/03/20, 1:49 am - Tamal: Then let him go.
21/03/20, 1:49 am - Vedika: But this shit is bad
21/03/20, 1:49 am - Vedika: Of course
21/03/20, 1:50 am - Tamal: If someone is encroaching your boundaries then no one knows better than you as to what to do next
21/03/20, 1:50 am - Tamal: Is he a friend?
21/03/20, 1:50 am - Tamal: Or a random guy?
21/03/20, 1:50 am - Vedika: He is my best friends ex
21/03/20, 1:50 am - Vedika: She fucked him ober
21/03/20, 1:51 am - Vedika: I was trying to help
21/03/20, 1:51 am - Tamal: Relationships are messy.
21/03/20, 1:51 am - Tamal: Give him some time. I am sure he's just hurt rn and doesn't mean harm
21/03/20, 1:52 am - Vedika: this was still shitty
21/03/20, 1:53 am - Tamal: Breathe Vedika. You got this dude.
21/03/20, 1:53 am - Tamal: When people are down they feel like clinging on to whatever they get.
21/03/20, 1:53 am - Tamal: I agree the approach matters. But...
21/03/20, 1:54 am - Tamal: We're all human
21/03/20, 1:55 am - Vedika: Insinuated that I wanted to fuck him?
21/03/20, 1:55 am - Vedika: This shit.
21/03/20, 1:56 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt like this. This is why I have to be mean.
21/03/20, 1:56 am - Tamal: Whoa. That's messed up then
21/03/20, 1:56 am - Tamal: Yeah you got every right to.
21/03/20, 1:57 am - Tamal: I mean that's just an age old 'guy-trick'. Keep away dude.
21/03/20, 1:57 am - Vedika: He said ‚Äòyou got a guy dude. I‚Äôm not interested. I just went through so much you really think i will now?‚Äô
21/03/20, 1:57 am - Vedika: Huh?
21/03/20, 1:57 am - Vedika: Temme?
21/03/20, 1:58 am - Tamal: Ugh. It's like an adage in our book.
21/03/20, 1:58 am - Tamal: Rebounds.
21/03/20, 1:58 am - Tamal: Women are empathetic. Statistically.
21/03/20, 1:58 am - Vedika: I go back to this.
21/03/20, 1:58 am - Tamal: Fuck him.
21/03/20, 1:58 am - Tamal: Wait.
21/03/20, 1:58 am - Tamal: I mean
21/03/20, 1:59 am - Vedika: I get that you got cheated on
21/03/20, 1:59 am - Vedika: I get it
21/03/20, 1:59 am - Vedika: Chill
21/03/20, 1:59 am - Vedika: But why project it on me
21/03/20, 1:59 am - Tamal: It doesn't justify him suggesting you do the same. Are you sure he got cheated on?
21/03/20, 1:59 am - Vedika: Yeah
21/03/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: He's like COVID 19 bearer. He wants to inflict pain upon everyone
21/03/20, 2:00 am - Vedika: Yes.
21/03/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: He was a friend?
21/03/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: Or just an acquaintance
21/03/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: ?
21/03/20, 2:01 am - Tamal: Chhor it doesn't matter. Whatever happened, happened. You did the right thing. Now don't let it ruin your peace.
21/03/20, 2:01 am - Vedika: Never met him
21/03/20, 2:01 am - Tamal: Try going to your happy place.
21/03/20, 2:01 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs the bench.
21/03/20, 2:01 am - Vedika: With my cat
21/03/20, 2:02 am - Tamal: Roll a joint/ play a song/ play with that cutie you got.
21/03/20, 2:02 am - Vedika: Sitting across Akash
21/03/20, 2:02 am - Vedika: The breeze
21/03/20, 2:02 am - Tamal: Ah.
21/03/20, 2:02 am - Tamal: Reminiscents.
21/03/20, 2:02 am - Tamal: I am glad you atleast got those.
21/03/20, 2:03 am - Vedika: I just miss my cat
21/03/20, 2:03 am - Vedika: She was my happiness man
21/03/20, 2:03 am - Vedika: *is
21/03/20, 2:03 am - Tamal: Shower a whole lot of love on something and watch it collapse. That's kinda been my life too.
21/03/20, 2:04 am - Tamal: So I guess I know what you feep
21/03/20, 2:04 am - Tamal: Feel

21/03/20, 2:04 am - Tamal: Fuck people.
21/03/20, 2:04 am - Tamal: No. Not entirely. That's what binds us to this place too I guess.
21/03/20, 2:05 am - Vedika: I dunno man
21/03/20, 2:05 am - Vedika: I feel sad tonight
21/03/20, 2:06 am - Tamal: I associate that with a color
21/03/20, 2:06 am - Tamal: Usually
21/03/20, 2:06 am - Tamal: A slight pink hue.
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: I just feel the urge to tell him I love him
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: This really made me feel sad man. Fuck.
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: How broken are we all.
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Tamal: Do it.
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Tamal: Tell him.
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: can‚Äôt take help?
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: I did
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Tamal: Do it again.
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Tamal: Doesn't make it less true
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: Can‚Äôt receive help.
21/03/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: do what?
21/03/20, 2:08 am - Tamal: No one is there to help. Everyone's fighting. Everyone has their shields down
21/03/20, 2:08 am - Vedika: I was helping.
21/03/20, 2:08 am - Vedika: He asked me to
21/03/20, 2:08 am - Vedika: good people die young man
21/03/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: 2 dudes got rammed on by a train trying to save an old woman near our college
21/03/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: It was Wednesday I guess
21/03/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: So I kinda agree
21/03/20, 2:09 am - Vedika: So it better to just be bad
21/03/20, 2:09 am - Vedika: *is it
21/03/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: Why do you want to live long?
21/03/20, 2:09 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt
21/03/20, 2:10 am - Vedika: But a better life
21/03/20, 2:10 am - Tamal: _Zindagi badi honi chahiye, lambi nahi_
21/03/20, 2:10 am - Vedika: I guess
21/03/20, 2:10 am - Vedika: I won‚Äôt anyway
21/03/20, 2:10 am - Tamal: We will see.
21/03/20, 2:10 am - Vedika: Yeah I know
21/03/20, 2:10 am - Vedika: Anyway
21/03/20, 2:10 am - Tamal: Have you seen Fight Club?
21/03/20, 2:10 am - Vedika: No man
21/03/20, 2:10 am - Tamal: Uska ek dialogue keeps ringing in my head whenever I feel down
21/03/20, 2:11 am - Tamal: Ek sec rukja.
21/03/20, 2:11 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt like violence in real life. I‚Äôm movies it‚Äôs fun. Not in real life.
21/03/20, 2:11 am - Vedika: *in
21/03/20, 2:11 am - Tamal: I see in the fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables, slaves with white collars, advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of the history man, no purpose or place, we have no Great war, no Great depression, our great war is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives, we've been all raised by television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars, but we won't and we're slowly learning that fact. and we're very very pissed off.
21/03/20, 2:11 am - Tamal: I feel this everytime I am sad.
21/03/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: Fuck this is me
21/03/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: Whenever I get pissed
21/03/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: I blame the media
21/03/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: Wait see this
21/03/20, 2:13 am - Vedika: Abhi hi bola uss hi bande ko
21/03/20, 2:13 am - Vedika: I can‚Äôt find
21/03/20, 2:13 am - Tamal: What did you say?
21/03/20, 2:14 am - Vedika: <Media omitted>
21/03/20, 2:15 am - Tamal: You said that to me too I think.
21/03/20, 2:15 am - Tamal: I faintly remember that line
21/03/20, 2:15 am - Vedika: Movies and media is fucking shit up
21/03/20, 2:15 am - Vedika: For real
21/03/20, 2:15 am - Vedika: And they‚Äôre reading everything. Hearing everything
21/03/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: I know me and you better than we can even imagine
21/03/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: *they know me and you
21/03/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: Movie helps build stereotypes. People like it because it's easier to categorize that way
21/03/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: Oh you like rock? You must smoke weed. Bam. Done.
21/03/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: It builds expectations
21/03/20, 2:17 am - Tamal: It means nothing.
21/03/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: And he thought don‚Äôt get attached was me flirting?????????
21/03/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: Bhaisahab. It was the exact opposite.
21/03/20, 2:17 am - Tamal: People see what they want to see.
21/03/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: ewwww
21/03/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: I feel dirty now
21/03/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: I even took a bath today
21/03/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: Bhakkkkk
21/03/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: Fuck this guy
21/03/20, 2:17 am - Tamal: Just breathe.
21/03/20, 2:18 am - Vedika: I dunno man
21/03/20, 2:18 am - Vedika: I am bery purana khayal wala person
21/03/20, 2:18 am - Vedika: When it comes to love
21/03/20, 2:18 am - Tamal: It's not wrong. Nothing is.
21/03/20, 2:18 am - Tamal: It's your book, man
21/03/20, 2:19 am - Tamal: You decide the plot
21/03/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: well
21/03/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt but I wish
21/03/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: I mean the end of the plot
21/03/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: Just the middle is mine. The most difficult part to write.
21/03/20, 2:19 am - Tamal: Yeah you can't decide someone else's fate in your book. Just yours. That's the trick I guess.
21/03/20, 2:20 am - Vedika: I can‚Äôt decide my end either
21/03/20, 2:20 am - Vedika: unless it‚Äôs suicide
21/03/20, 2:20 am - Tamal: You know the other day I was venting to you na, I said that I don't feel ...
21/03/20, 2:21 am - Tamal: How do you put it? Contentment, I guess
21/03/20, 2:21 am - Vedika: Starry eyed, never satisfied?
21/03/20, 2:21 am - Tamal: That's not you deciding your end. That's you making a 13 vol book and writing just 5 volumes in it
21/03/20, 2:22 am - Vedika: Hahahahaha truuuuu
21/03/20, 2:22 am - Tamal: I think this is a reference I don't get
21/03/20, 2:22 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs ok do u like it?
21/03/20, 2:23 am - Tamal: It hurts me.
21/03/20, 2:23 am - Tamal: Because of how true it is I guess
21/03/20, 2:23 am - Vedika: Yes I love it
21/03/20, 2:23 am - Vedika: Sure know something - KISS
21/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: I will check that out
21/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: On a similar note
21/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: And if you're still breathing you're the lucky ones
Coz most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs
21/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: I love this line
21/03/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: Man, I love Daughter

11/04/20, 1:36 am - Vedika: See how the conversation goes
11/04/20, 1:36 am - Tamal: plis. Your description makes me want to see it more.
11/04/20, 1:36 am - Vedika: No
11/04/20, 1:36 am - Tamal: Aaaaaaaaaaaa. I was about to say something mean aur kuch nahi
11/04/20, 1:37 am - Tamal: It wasn't the truth. So it doesn't matter.
11/04/20, 1:37 am - Vedika: bolna hai toh bolo
11/04/20, 1:37 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt really care for mean
11/04/20, 1:37 am - Tamal: nahi bolna. I don't like myself when I am mean to others.
11/04/20, 1:37 am - Tamal: I like myself nice. :)
11/04/20, 1:38 am - Tamal: Like the goodest boy in town.
11/04/20, 1:38 am - Tamal: Will give Casper a run for his money
11/04/20, 1:38 am - Vedika: you‚Äôre controlling who you are
11/04/20, 1:38 am - Vedika: You‚Äôre afraid to be seen as a bas person
11/04/20, 1:38 am - Vedika: Alright
11/04/20, 1:38 am - Tamal: I am not afraid of that.
11/04/20, 1:38 am - Tamal: If I say something mean to you I will keep thinking about that
11/04/20, 1:39 am - Tamal: And then I WILL apologize
11/04/20, 1:39 am - Tamal: It's in my nature.
11/04/20, 1:39 am - Vedika: *bad
11/04/20, 1:39 am - Tamal: Utna akal hai mere mein to fill in the blanks ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
11/04/20, 1:40 am - Tamal: And is that a NO no or if I persuade you a couple times more might be a YES no?
11/04/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: No.
11/04/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm a man of my word.
11/04/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: Itihaas ke panno mein tera naam sunhere aksharo mein likha jayega chu.
11/04/20, 1:41 am - Vedika: ok thanks
11/04/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: not fair man. Why not.
11/04/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: üò¢üò¢
11/04/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: I really want to see it.
11/04/20, 1:42 am - Tamal: but then chawa r pawa üòû
11/04/20, 1:42 am - Vedika: what
11/04/20, 1:42 am - Tamal: oh. Bengali proverb
11/04/20, 1:43 am - Tamal: chawa means 'to want'
Pawa means 'to get' 
So it means that you don't get everything you want.
11/04/20, 1:43 am - Vedika: ok...
11/04/20, 1:43 am - Vedika: but you can
11/04/20, 1:43 am - Vedika: Like
11/04/20, 1:43 am - Vedika: You just need to want it enough to get it
11/04/20, 1:44 am - Vedika: It just means you don‚Äôt want everything with the same passion
11/04/20, 1:44 am - Tamal: Fuck you. I love Casper with all my heart and I kinda deal with you so I think I deserve that picture
11/04/20, 1:45 am - Vedika: no
11/04/20, 1:45 am - Tamal: ok. won't ask again :(
11/04/20, 1:46 am - Vedika: Seeü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
11/04/20, 1:46 am - Tamal: there's a fine line between persuading and being annoying. I don't want to get in your bad book.
11/04/20, 1:47 am - Vedika: LOL
11/04/20, 1:47 am - Vedika: if you can persuade me
11/04/20, 1:47 am - Vedika: You‚Äôll be in my holy books
11/04/20, 1:48 am - Tamal: how long do you think till people start treating batman as a God and the comics as a holy script?
11/04/20, 1:48 am - Tamal: I will totally join that religion
11/04/20, 1:48 am - Vedika: goodness sake
11/04/20, 1:48 am - Vedika: Why are guys so obsessed with this
11/04/20, 1:48 am - Vedika: It is a comic
11/04/20, 1:48 am - Vedika: In the future people know it‚Äôs a comic
11/04/20, 1:48 am - Tamal: Guys are obsessed about other things too. Trust me.
11/04/20, 1:48 am - Vedika: Holy book nai likha hai kabhi bhi
11/04/20, 1:48 am - Vedika: Comics are fictitious
11/04/20, 1:49 am - Tamal: So are religions.
11/04/20, 1:49 am - Vedika: YOU DONT KNOW FOR SURE
11/04/20, 1:50 am - Vedika: kahin nai likha hai fictitious hai nai
11/04/20, 1:50 am - Vedika: Comics ka pata hai
11/04/20, 1:50 am - Vedika: Ki haan hai
11/04/20, 1:50 am - Vedika: <Media omitted>
11/04/20, 1:50 am - Tamal: Okay. I will change my stance the day I find it non fictitious. I am not rigid that way.
11/04/20, 1:50 am - Vedika: You
11/04/20, 1:50 am - Tamal: I told you a better one I think
11/04/20, 1:50 am - Vedika: Abbey but proof bai hai
11/04/20, 1:51 am - Vedika: You said the same thing
11/04/20, 1:51 am - Vedika: same thing
11/04/20, 1:51 am - Tamal: It also involved being 19 since Covid 19
11/04/20, 1:51 am - Vedika: Oh haan
11/04/20, 1:51 am - Tamal: Can I please get that picture
11/04/20, 1:52 am - Tamal: And that song.
11/04/20, 1:52 am - Tamal: Me lady.
11/04/20, 1:57 am - Vedika: Noop.
11/04/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: you're ruuuuudddddeeee.
11/04/20, 2:00 am - Vedika: Yeah I‚Äôm not afraid to be
11/04/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: Whenever you feel gracious drop them here.
11/04/20, 2:00 am - Tamal: yeah no shit.
11/04/20, 2:00 am - Vedika: Do u know Chhattisgarh mein what a couple did
11/04/20, 2:01 am - Tamal: nope.
11/04/20, 2:01 am - Vedika: Named their twins
11/04/20, 2:01 am - Vedika: Covid and corona
11/04/20, 2:01 am - Tamal: tell me about whims
11/04/20, 2:02 am - Tamal: I genuinely want to befriend that Corona guy just to tell him years later 'Go corona. Corona go'
11/04/20, 2:05 am - Vedika: fucking imagine how bad the bullying will be for the kids
11/04/20, 2:06 am - Tamal: arre bhai that's just cheap publicity. I bet they're changing those names in the affidavit 6 months later
11/04/20, 2:07 am - Tamal: Like the woman who ran naked in Fifa wc just to get publicity and her bf's business boomed.
11/04/20, 2:07 am - Vedika: lol
11/04/20, 2:08 am - Tamal: I mean I would run naked too if it helped me but that's most probably going to be detrimental to my cause.
11/04/20, 2:08 am - Vedika: Yes
11/04/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: .
11/04/20, 2:10 am - Tamal: Gire hue ko laat maarke kya maza aata hai?
11/04/20, 2:10 am - Vedika: I just agreed to what you said
11/04/20, 2:10 am - Tamal: nahi karna tha
11/04/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: usually if someone agrees
11/04/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: people take it positively
11/04/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: Unless you didn‚Äôt mean what you said
11/04/20, 2:13 am - Tamal: you must be real fun to hang around with
11/04/20, 2:14 am - Vedika: Maybe
11/04/20, 2:15 am - Tamal: I am sleepy. Wo bhejegi ya sone jau?
11/04/20, 2:15 am - Vedika: So ja
11/04/20, 2:15 am - Tamal: What if I die in sleep
11/04/20, 2:15 am - Tamal: Won't you feel guilty
11/04/20, 2:15 am - Tamal: ?
11/04/20, 2:15 am - Vedika: you won‚Äôt
11/04/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: and no
11/04/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong
11/04/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm just refusing to send a picture of myself to a guy on the Internet
11/04/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: whoa.
11/04/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: Okay.
11/04/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: Sorry.
11/04/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: Lol
11/04/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: I was kidding
11/04/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: Chill
11/04/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: sach sun ke fat kyu jaata hai. Just another way of saying things.
11/04/20, 2:19 am - Tamal: Yeah no. That's the truth. I am but the guy on internet.
11/04/20, 2:19 am - Tamal: night night.
11/04/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: Oh god
11/04/20, 2:20 am - Vedika: So wut i could be an old man who‚Äôs a Pedo
11/04/20, 2:26 am - Tamal: if you can't tell from our previous encounter on this thing, I take this seriously. I don't like this to be joked about. I am very very careful of how I behave with girls. To some extent I am paranoid. So even a remote indication that I am acting like a creep really puts me off. I remember word to word of what you said last time. I can't help it.
11/04/20, 2:26 am - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt call u a creep
11/04/20, 2:26 am - Vedika: You‚Äôre overthinking it
11/04/20, 2:27 am - Vedika: for a photograph
11/04/20, 2:28 am - Tamal: okay. anyway I should go sleep. good night.
11/04/20, 2:28 am - Vedika: Alrighty
11/04/20, 2:43 am - Tamal: okay here's the deal. If you did mean that, let me know. If you didn't, which I think is the case, please never do that again. Not even in a funny way. I have been trying to browse internet casually for the past 15 mins but I keep going back to that. I don't like it. I know maybe it sounds silly to you but it isn't for me. I hope you understand that.
11/04/20, 2:44 am - Vedika: Yes I do
11/04/20, 2:44 am - Vedika: Don‚Äôt overthink it
11/04/20, 2:45 am - Tamal: aight cool. get some sleep
11/04/20, 2:45 am - Vedika: Abbe chu
11/04/20, 2:45 am - Vedika: Apna dekhna

11/04/20, 2:48 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm still shit
11/04/20, 2:48 am - Vedika: Love of my life
11/04/20, 2:49 am - Tamal: Hey dude. Know your worth.
11/04/20, 2:49 am - Tamal: It sucks to tell you that you're gold. You should know that
11/04/20, 2:50 am - Tamal: One friend recommended me. And fun fact I never forget people who recommend me music.
11/04/20, 2:51 am - Vedika: Ooooh naiceeee
11/04/20, 2:52 am - Tamal: aswekeepsearching
11/04/20, 2:54 am - Vedika: Did I tell u?
11/04/20, 2:55 am - Tamal: Yes. Kalga

11/04/20, 3:01 am - Tamal: I did. It was in one of your stories. I also checked out other songs. It's lit. But Kalga got the first impression on me so that's going to stay.
11/04/20, 3:02 am - Vedika: Yes.

11/04/20, 6:26 pm - Tamal: You made him do that for your assignment ya pehle ka clip hai?
11/04/20, 6:26 pm - Vedika: He willingly did it
11/04/20, 6:26 pm - Vedika: He‚Äôd do anything for me
11/04/20, 6:26 pm - Vedika: and vice a versa
11/04/20, 6:27 pm - Tamal: Hold on to that. Not many people one gets to say that about.
11/04/20, 6:27 pm - Vedika: Of course
11/04/20, 6:30 pm - Tamal: <Media omitted>

13/04/20, 1:07 am - Tamal: Not fair. I kinda want to do it again
13/04/20, 1:07 am - Vedika: Cause existentialism is more imp
13/04/20, 1:08 am - Tamal: Let me see if there are more customized questions or any app. I love this game.
13/04/20, 1:09 am - Tamal: You can't throw in joke answers and real answers all in one dude. That's unfair
13/04/20, 1:13 am - Vedika: why not
13/04/20, 1:13 am - Vedika: Erre wtf
13/04/20, 1:13 am - Tamal: no. This was important to me :'3
13/04/20, 1:14 am - Vedika: this is not an accurate estimate of how well you know someone
13/04/20, 1:15 am - Vedika: Wah you can‚Äôt do it twice
13/04/20, 1:15 am - Tamal: I can.
13/04/20, 1:15 am - Tamal: even then I missed one
13/04/20, 1:15 am - Tamal: Lol

13/04/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: These are all so close. I think this one's right but then I go naaah it's too easy. And the one I think is right is actually right but then I don't click it because it's too easyyy. What's this sorcery.

13/04/20, 2:20 am - Tamal: :/
13/04/20, 2:20 am - Tamal: I kinda have this bad habit of slacking off after doing something that i think is nice
13/04/20, 2:29 am - Tamal: you're busy I guess. night night.
13/04/20, 2:33 am - Vedika: Matlab?
13/04/20, 2:35 am - Tamal: doesn't matter. I did tell you how I feel when I ask someone whether they're free or not, they say yes and then disappear. nevermind.
13/04/20, 2:36 am - Vedika: Temme
13/04/20, 2:45 am - Tamal: no look I understand you got better things to do, so just do that. and I am not saying it in an angry/rude tone. I genuinely mean it. clearly something else interests you more. you don't have to shit talk with me, that's okay. I understand. save your time, i will too. good night.

14/04/20, 8:58 pm - Tamal: no worries. And don't fret over it. Sometimes you're mean unnecessarily. That wasn't the case that yesterday. You were right.
14/04/20, 8:58 pm - Tamal: you don't need to do that. Let's keep it low key
14/04/20, 8:59 pm - Tamal: and how did you guys' live session pan out?

15/04/20, 2:33 am - Vedika: The caged bird one?
15/04/20, 2:33 am - Tamal: not yet
15/04/20, 2:33 am - Tamal: <Media omitted>
15/04/20, 2:34 am - Vedika: ...
15/04/20, 2:34 am - Tamal: kaunsa
15/04/20, 2:34 am - Vedika: This
15/04/20, 2:34 am - Tamal: You've drawn this?
15/04/20, 2:34 am - Tamal: Wtf
15/04/20, 2:34 am - Vedika: What no
15/04/20, 2:34 am - Vedika: Wtf
15/04/20, 2:34 am - Tamal: .
15/04/20, 2:35 am - Tamal: What's this about?
15/04/20, 2:35 am - Vedika: This
15/04/20, 2:35 am - Vedika: Dummy
15/04/20, 2:35 am - Tamal: oh oh.
15/04/20, 2:36 am - Tamal: I haven't thought yet. But I can come up with some explanation
15/04/20, 2:36 am - Tamal: It's not wacky. It seems meaningful
15/04/20, 2:36 am - Vedika: Bolo
15/04/20, 2:36 am - Vedika: It is
15/04/20, 2:37 am - Tamal: It's a metaphor for a person.
15/04/20, 2:38 am - Vedika: what metaphor
15/04/20, 2:38 am - Tamal: Broadly. But yeah it's difficult to deduce.
15/04/20, 2:38 am - Tamal: Can you tell me specific things as to what they are?
15/04/20, 2:38 am - Tamal: not the meaning. Just the thighs
15/04/20, 2:38 am - Tamal: *things
15/04/20, 2:38 am - Vedika: bolo bolo
15/04/20, 2:38 am - Tamal: <Media omitted>
15/04/20, 2:39 am - Tamal: okay here's one explanation
15/04/20, 2:39 am - Vedika: What
15/04/20, 2:40 am - Tamal: I am assuming that thing is food for birds. The birds don't want to get inside the cage because from their perspective they'll get stuck if they go for the food. But they don't know that the cage is open. And they can leave anytime.
15/04/20, 2:43 am - Tamal: I've got another perspective. This time with the thing as a source of light.
15/04/20, 2:43 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs not a cage
15/04/20, 2:44 am - Tamal: Sush. Art is open to interpretation.
15/04/20, 2:45 am - Tamal: the colors of the birds are opposite. So it represents the good and bad in people. The tiny slit lets some light to the mind but it emanates so much more light to others. As in we can only see a part of the whole good in us. But others can see so much more.
15/04/20, 2:46 am - Vedika: the head is left
15/04/20, 2:46 am - Vedika: I think the neck will be something weird
15/04/20, 2:47 am - Tamal: wait. Tell me was I close to the intended meaning?
15/04/20, 2:47 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt think so
15/04/20, 2:47 am - Vedika: But i like it
15/04/20, 2:47 am - Tamal: aight cool. Don't tell me.
15/04/20, 2:47 am - Vedika: My brain isn‚Äôt so positive
15/04/20, 2:47 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt know yet
15/04/20, 2:47 am - Vedika: I‚Äôll know what it means jal
15/04/20, 2:47 am - Vedika: *kal
15/04/20, 2:48 am - Tamal: Oi. I like it though. No no. I love it. It's an album cover for me.
15/04/20, 2:48 am - Tamal: Stop saying it's weird. It's beautiful
15/04/20, 2:48 am - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs weird
15/04/20, 2:48 am - Vedika: Surreal is my forte
15/04/20, 2:48 am - Tamal: .
15/04/20, 2:49 am - Tamal: It is. Keep at it.
15/04/20, 2:49 am - Vedika: Oh
15/04/20, 2:49 am - Vedika: Yes
15/04/20, 2:49 am - Vedika: It is weird
15/04/20, 2:49 am - Vedika: SEEERRR. THID IS THE BLACK AND WHITE
15/04/20, 2:49 am - Vedika: my fucking doublethinking
15/04/20, 2:50 am - Tamal: Yin and the yang
15/04/20, 3:05 am - Tamal: <Media omitted>
15/04/20, 12:05 pm - Vedika: üò≠
15/04/20, 12:40 pm - Tamal: hieeee. Good morning
16/04/20, 12:07 pm - Vedika: Oh shiiiieeeettrr
16/04/20, 1:27 pm - Tamal: :3
16/04/20, 3:48 pm - Vedika: Oi
16/04/20, 3:48 pm - Vedika: Which poem did you like most of mine?
16/04/20, 3:48 pm - Vedika: Or which one seems like a song?
16/04/20, 6:41 pm - Tamal: idk. anyone
16/04/20, 6:43 pm - Vedika: wut
16/04/20, 6:43 pm - Vedika: you okay?
16/04/20, 7:11 pm - Tamal: yeah man. you good?
16/04/20, 7:18 pm - Vedika: Yeah yeah
16/04/20, 9:17 pm - Tamal: Hey look man I'd accept that sometimes we've had really nice conversations that I am sure both of us enjoyed. But lately I have felt like you're really not into it (conversations) and I am pushing boundaries. If you haven't already figured that out, I kinda like you. And I know you have a boyfriend and yada yada but I don't want anything. Idc whether you're with someone or not, I still won't want anything. But sometimes it feels like I am way into talking and you're ignoring me (maybe unintentionally, maybe intentionally). And let's be honest here, me getting mad at you for not being into me as much as I am into you is stupid, silly and laughable. So I figured a minimal contact is the best that I can do rn. I don't want to do all those delete and block stuff because I really like your art but I also don't want to push and shove you to make space for me. Be yourself, try to be happy, create. Aur kya? whatever cliche you can think of. So yeah... 


And really I didn't want to say all these things but I am like this. I don't like to be rude. And I think I have been rude to you since this morning. Sorry for that. Your normal is my rude, it seems :3 So you can kinda also figure out where I am coming from. Okay. I'll stop. Novel nahi likhna.
16/04/20, 9:18 pm - Vedika: Tamal
16/04/20, 9:18 pm - Vedika: Plis

16/04/20, 9:44 pm - Vedika: Dark Bride, bathed in blood.
Night Bride, Sanguine Wife.
Join with me this night;
Empty me of my wretched life.

Till death do us part 
Till death do 
I do I do 
us apart 


Let me lick the black blood
From your marble skin.
Draw me into the Sepulchre
Of your heart lying within.

Death is a whore, 
Like you and me.
(Marry me, bury me)
coeternal like the holy trinity
 
Dark Bride, rend my skin;
Tear my torso open wide.
Drink from my cascading life

Till death do us part. 
Till death I do I do 
Do you?

Until the crimson flow does subside.
‚ÄúYou may now kiss the Bride,‚Äù
said the voices.

(I do I do I do I do.)

Take my Raven and deliver this dove.
Drain me,
destroy me,
scar me.
I am your vessel, take what you will.
Violate my dying body, my love;
Deliver the final kill.

Till death do us part 
Till death do us 
I do I do 
do you? 
Death is a whore, 
Like you and me. 
Violate my dying body, my love;
Deliver the final kill.
Till death do us part 
Till death I do 
Us apart

21/04/20, 4:53 pm - Tamal: But what it sounds like to me is like the climax of a slow movie where everything finally makes sense and clouds disappear and the protagonist takes a stroll along the road as the camera pans away and away from him.

04/05/20, 2:14 am - Tamal: _Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why they call it the present._
04/05/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs from panda
04/05/20, 3:09 am - Tamal: Yes ma'am. The gift of originality has ever evaded me.

07/05/20, 11:23 pm - Vedika: *Shocked*
07/05/20, 11:23 pm - Tamal: that ship has sailed :3
07/05/20, 11:23 pm - Tamal: Look at my status. It's so funny.
07/05/20, 11:26 pm - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt get it
07/05/20, 11:28 pm - Tamal: Self deprecating humor. 
Basically I am shit. But if I get a girl that wears glasses it would take longer for her to see that I am shit because had her vision been perfect she would have dumped me instantly.
07/05/20, 11:28 pm - Vedika: Oh
07/05/20, 11:28 pm - Vedika: Comma nai hai

07/05/20, 11:34 pm - Vedika: But it‚Äôs v good
07/05/20, 11:37 pm - Tamal: Monisha beta *PM CARES* bolo, *Money heist* is too middle class.

08/05/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: errr it‚Äôs probably not my original idea
08/05/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: Like original art idk
08/05/20, 1:21 am - Tamal: Yeah maybe it's some Pinterest stuff.
08/05/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: yeah maybe
08/05/20, 1:21 am - Tamal: Aww. That's so cute.
08/05/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: I saw it somewhere
08/05/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: No no
08/05/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: She wanted to gloat about it to her friends
08/05/20, 1:21 am - Tamal: No. She's proud of you
08/05/20, 1:21 am - Tamal: Let her be.
08/05/20, 1:21 am - Vedika: No
08/05/20, 1:22 am - Vedika: Shush.
08/05/20, 1:22 am - Tamal: I'd be proud of you too.

08/05/20, 1:23 am - Vedika: Let‚Äôs go past that
08/05/20, 1:23 am - Tamal: Why
08/05/20, 1:23 am - Tamal: Anything bad?
08/05/20, 1:24 am - Vedika: I just realised something which altered my reality.
08/05/20, 1:24 am - Vedika: which I was in denial about. Or had doubts if it was what it was.
08/05/20, 1:24 am - Tamal: okay.
08/05/20, 1:25 am - Tamal: share.
08/05/20, 1:25 am - Tamal: or don't.

08/05/20, 1:26 am - Tamal: emotionally, I am guessing.
08/05/20, 1:26 am - Vedika: This message was deleted
08/05/20, 1:27 am - Tamal: so how.
08/05/20, 1:27 am - Tamal: like you love a cat and it still scratches you
08/05/20, 1:27 am - Tamal: ?
08/05/20, 1:27 am - Vedika: :)
08/05/20, 1:27 am - Tamal: you're a dum dum. I adore you.
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs not a joke.
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Vedika: Let‚Äôs talk later.
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Tamal: Sunn. I have told you umpteen times that feel free to share.
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Tamal: if you don't want to I can't force it.
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Vedika: You‚Äôre joking around.
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Tamal: but honestly it feels better
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Vedika: And I‚Äôm not here for it.
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Tamal: I am not.
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Vedika: It doesn‚Äôt.
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Vedika: You are. I‚Äôm out.
08/05/20, 1:28 am - Tamal: How is this a joke.
08/05/20, 1:29 am - Tamal: Sush. You are staying here.
08/05/20, 1:29 am - Tamal: And telling me
08/05/20, 1:29 am - Vedika: No.
08/05/20, 1:29 am - Tamal: Let me in. won't let you down I swear by whatever I consider holy.
08/05/20, 1:29 am - Vedika: No.
08/05/20, 1:30 am - Tamal: Vedika.
08/05/20, 1:30 am - Tamal: I wasn't joking baba
08/05/20, 1:30 am - Tamal: I swear.
08/05/20, 1:30 am - Vedika: Please shut up.
08/05/20, 1:30 am - Vedika: You‚Äôre making it worse
08/05/20, 1:30 am - Tamal: am I? I am sorry.
08/05/20, 1:30 am - Vedika: ok
08/05/20, 1:31 am - Tamal: want to talk about something else
08/05/20, 1:31 am - Tamal: Or no?
08/05/20, 1:31 am - Vedika: I have already answered.
08/05/20, 1:31 am - Tamal: even I feel crap now.
08/05/20, 1:32 am - Tamal: I will see you around I guess.
08/05/20, 1:32 am - Vedika: Oh I‚Äôm sorry. Like you love a cat and it scratches you?
08/05/20, 1:33 am - Tamal: it wasn't a joke. I would own up if it was.
08/05/20, 1:33 am - Tamal: but you decide.
08/05/20, 1:33 am - Vedika: Do you know what abusive is
08/05/20, 1:33 am - Vedika: or is it just someone saying two means words and you feeling like crap
08/05/20, 1:34 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs not funny
08/05/20, 1:34 am - Tamal: I don't want to hurt anyone intentionally and I don't like being hurt back either.
08/05/20, 1:34 am - Tamal: that makes sense?
08/05/20, 1:34 am - Vedika: you need to be intentionally not hurting someone
08/05/20, 1:34 am - Vedika: Not just assume you don‚Äôt want to
08/05/20, 1:34 am - Vedika: This is easy
08/05/20, 1:35 am - Tamal: if you're hurt, I am sorry.
08/05/20, 1:37 am - Tamal: you won't share anything with me. Idk why. Maybe you're not like this. Or maybe I am unworthy. Or whatever. So I was trying to price words out of you. I wasn't looking to hurt you. if you think I find humor in your pain then there has been a terrific lack of judgement on both sides.
08/05/20, 1:39 am - Vedika: you‚Äôre belittling it
08/05/20, 1:39 am - Vedika: and it‚Äôs not cool
08/05/20, 1:39 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt care
08/05/20, 1:39 am - Tamal: it wasn't my intention.
08/05/20, 1:39 am - Tamal: and I see it now. I am sorry.
08/05/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: okay
08/05/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: Thanks for seeing it
08/05/20, 1:40 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm not hurt. I couldn‚Äôt care less. But you can wait a while to make jokes you know
08/05/20, 1:40 am - Tamal: I wasn't even making one
08/05/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: I was just trying to get you out of your mum zone.
08/05/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: but maybe you're right
08/05/20, 1:41 am - Tamal: Maybe you're better off sharing it with someone else who isn't a complete idiot
08/05/20, 1:41 am - Vedika: jab koi bol raha about abuse
08/05/20, 1:42 am - Vedika: and you try to act cool
08/05/20, 1:42 am - Vedika: And interrogate instead of empathise
08/05/20, 1:43 am - Vedika: Then crack a belittling joke
08/05/20, 1:43 am - Vedika: Expect worse than this
08/05/20, 1:43 am - Vedika: Yes
08/05/20, 1:43 am - Tamal: I am sorry.
08/05/20, 1:44 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs all cool
08/05/20, 1:44 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm not letting you in tho.
08/05/20, 1:45 am - Tamal: idk what to say. you're correct about everything. I am sorry.
08/05/20, 1:46 am - Vedika: chill
08/05/20, 1:46 am - Vedika: Let it go
08/05/20, 1:46 am - Vedika: I got defensive too. Pretty recent it is.
08/05/20, 1:46 am - Vedika: I warned to let it go beforehandüôÑ
08/05/20, 1:47 am - Tamal: yeah. i will ttyl. I feel like puking.
08/05/20, 1:47 am - Vedika: oh like when you get a burp?
08/05/20, 1:47 am - Vedika: Idk how to shitty
08/05/20, 1:47 am - Vedika: Take care
08/05/20, 1:48 am - Vedika: To be
08/05/20, 2:07 am - Tamal: I am sorry. Truth be told I am not the person you should be spending your time on.
08/05/20, 2:07 am - Tamal: No this isn't some pity invoking text. Don't even dare say sorry, because you're right.
08/05/20, 2:08 am - Tamal: I have always been a piece of crap and will always be that.
08/05/20, 2:08 am - Tamal: You'll find better use of your time I am sure.
Much love.
08/05/20, 2:09 am - Vedika: Alright
08/05/20, 2:09 am - Tamal: <Media omitted>
08/05/20, 2:09 am - Vedika: Chill
08/05/20, 2:09 am - Vedika: And shut up
08/05/20, 2:09 am - Vedika: Everything is normal
08/05/20, 2:10 am - Tamal: I am not hurt by what you said. You say mean stuff all the time. I am hurt at how accurate it was.
08/05/20, 2:10 am - Vedika: I know I seem harsh
08/05/20, 2:11 am - Vedika: But I know I‚Äôm right by a whooping 96 percentile
08/05/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: You need to be empathetic towards yourself
08/05/20, 2:12 am - Tamal: you need to cut me off
08/05/20, 2:12 am - Vedika: No
08/05/20, 2:13 am - Vedika: Don‚Äôt tell me what to do
08/05/20, 2:13 am - Vedika: Stop being the victim
08/05/20, 2:13 am - Vedika: I just scratched you a bit
08/05/20, 2:14 am - Vedika: Just tend to it a bit and you‚Äôll be fine
08/05/20, 2:14 am - Vedika: Start here
08/05/20, 2:14 am - Vedika: You hurt yourself when you fuck up or you think you have
08/05/20, 2:15 am - Vedika: Kuch bologe ki main so jaun
08/05/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: You deleted this message
08/05/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: sleep.
08/05/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: goodnight
08/05/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: That‚Äôs not healthy
08/05/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: Ghanta neend aayega
08/05/20, 2:16 am - Tamal: never claimed to be
08/05/20, 2:16 am - Vedika: Don‚Äôt idealise paim
08/05/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: *pain
08/05/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: It's not glory
08/05/20, 2:17 am - Tamal: I choose.
08/05/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: Again.
08/05/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: Don‚Äôt idealise it.
08/05/20, 2:17 am - Tamal: but no honestly. you can do better than me. please do better.
08/05/20, 2:17 am - Vedika: Which tells me you don‚Äôt know much about it yet
08/05/20, 2:18 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm not with you so idk what you‚Äôre talking about here
08/05/20, 2:18 am - Vedika: You have a practical brain
08/05/20, 2:18 am - Tamal: ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è spend that time better
08/05/20, 2:18 am - Vedika: Or you think you do
08/05/20, 2:18 am - Vedika: Stop denying other parts of yourself
08/05/20, 2:18 am - Tamal: was someone saying something about empathy in here a couple mins ago.
08/05/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: Look man
08/05/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: I‚Äôve been there
08/05/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: Where I chose pain
08/05/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: Trust me
08/05/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: I didn‚Äôt get it either then
08/05/20, 2:19 am - Vedika: Doesn‚Äôt mean my pain wasn‚Äôt real
08/05/20, 2:20 am - Vedika: Just that it wasn‚Äôt as big as I made it to be. It was just a scratch. Not a wound.
08/05/20, 2:21 am - Vedika: There‚Äôs a lot in life and by choosing pain. We‚Äôre being stupid.
08/05/20, 2:21 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs easy to waste a life. That‚Äôs why people say life is short.
08/05/20, 2:21 am - Tamal: there are a lot of things which aren't healthy. sometimes we do things just because we want to.
08/05/20, 2:21 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs the longest thing you‚Äôll ever have
08/05/20, 2:21 am - Vedika: How is it short.
08/05/20, 2:22 am - Vedika: Like I said. Not efficient.
08/05/20, 2:22 am - Vedika: You wanna be efficient, right
08/05/20, 2:22 am - Vedika: Productive
08/05/20, 2:22 am - Tamal: nope.
08/05/20, 2:22 am - Tamal: I wanna cry all my life about how crap me and my life is.
08/05/20, 2:22 am - Tamal: that sounds good to me
08/05/20, 2:22 am - Vedika: Well then upto you
08/05/20, 2:22 am - Vedika: Have fun
08/05/20, 2:23 am - Tamal: will do.
08/05/20, 2:23 am - Vedika: You‚Äôre being stupid
08/05/20, 2:23 am - Tamal: you go on and do stuff that really attracts you.
08/05/20, 2:23 am - Vedika: But your choice
08/05/20, 2:23 am - Tamal: that really is worth doing.
08/05/20, 2:23 am - Vedika: Yo nothing attracts me
08/05/20, 2:23 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm emotionless meat
08/05/20, 2:24 am - Vedika: Don‚Äôt tell me what is worth
08/05/20, 2:24 am - Vedika: What isn‚Äôt
08/05/20, 2:24 am - Vedika: I know
08/05/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: I can't tell you anything and you can tell me everything
08/05/20, 2:24 am - Vedika: Yes
08/05/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: Am I getting it now?
08/05/20, 2:24 am - Tamal: Okay
08/05/20, 2:24 am - Vedika: Cause you‚Äôre being mean to yourself
08/05/20, 2:25 am - Vedika: If being mean to myself bolo. Kaun mana kiya.
08/05/20, 2:25 am - Tamal: you sound apologetic for being right.
08/05/20, 2:25 am - Vedika: Always
08/05/20, 2:25 am - Vedika: I wanna be wrong
08/05/20, 2:25 am - Vedika: Kabhi toh
08/05/20, 2:25 am - Vedika: But whatever
08/05/20, 2:25 am - Tamal: You are. koi bolta nahi tujhe bas.
08/05/20, 2:26 am - Vedika: That‚Äôs not true. lol.

08/05/20, 2:26 am - Vedika: About certain things. I am wrong.
08/05/20, 2:27 am - Tamal: I stopped watching bojack midway. I feel him. I want to be him.
08/05/20, 2:27 am - Tamal: I am already halfway there.
08/05/20, 2:27 am - Vedika: But like I said. 96 percentile.
08/05/20, 2:27 am - Vedika: 4 is all me. About me.
08/05/20, 2:27 am - Tamal: Change that number. It's bothering me. It isn't even high. Like you get no calls in IIMs with that percentile
08/05/20, 2:28 am - Vedika: Depressing.
08/05/20, 2:28 am - Vedika: I can read people.

08/05/20, 2:30 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs exhausting
08/05/20, 2:30 am - Tamal: Do you claim to know me?

08/05/20, 2:31 am - Vedika: That‚Äôs it
08/05/20, 2:31 am - Vedika: Knowing anyone as a person completely is next to impossible
08/05/20, 2:31 am - Tamal: no it's not. some people are very simple
08/05/20, 2:32 am - Vedika: No
08/05/20, 2:32 am - Vedika: Don‚Äôt judge
08/05/20, 2:32 am - Tamal: Like my dadi. just had 2 concerns. When's lunch and when is she going to die
08/05/20, 2:32 am - Vedika: They seem simple

08/05/20, 2:36 am - Tamal: ever since we started talking have you learnt/realised anything
08/05/20, 2:37 am - Vedika: About what
08/05/20, 2:37 am - Tamal: anything.
08/05/20, 2:37 am - Tamal: something that sounded so correct that you had to change your view on it
Or something you didn't know of and now you're curious
O
08/05/20, 2:37 am - Tamal: Anything basically
08/05/20, 2:38 am - Vedika: That I act hot-headedly at times
08/05/20, 2:38 am - Vedika: Emphasis on act
08/05/20, 2:38 am - Tamal: um. okay.

08/05/20, 2:43 am - Vedika: alright
08/05/20, 2:43 am - Vedika: he didn‚Äôt make me fall in love with him if that‚Äôs what you think
08/05/20, 2:43 am - Tamal: I didn't think that
08/05/20, 2:43 am - Vedika: we had a discussion
08/05/20, 2:43 am - Vedika: it was something simple
08/05/20, 2:43 am - Vedika: I never bothered to think about
08/05/20, 2:44 am - Tamal: I have realised we aren't ever going to be in the same frequency ever.
08/05/20, 2:44 am - Vedika: accha

08/05/20, 2:44 am - Tamal: also experiences. But let's not.
08/05/20, 2:45 am - Tamal: you're nice and shit
08/05/20, 2:45 am - Tamal: I am shallow af.
08/05/20, 2:45 am - Tamal: don't empathise please
08/05/20, 2:45 am - Vedika: Experiences with me?
08/05/20, 2:45 am - Vedika: I won‚Äôt
08/05/20, 2:45 am - Vedika: I just think you haven‚Äôt thought about certain aspects of life.
08/05/20, 2:45 am - Vedika: Not shallow
08/05/20, 2:46 am - Vedika: Just naive
08/05/20, 2:46 am - Tamal: yes I think you kinda get it. And now the interesting part. I would love nothing more than to be this same dude at 60.
08/05/20, 2:46 am - Tamal: I just don't want to be all deep and shit.
08/05/20, 2:46 am - Tamal: I am happy or whatever you can call this the way I am
08/05/20, 2:47 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs good
08/05/20, 2:47 am - Vedika: I envy people like you
08/05/20, 2:47 am - Tamal: lol. You should do just the opposite.
08/05/20, 2:47 am - Tamal: and hence this
08/05/20, 2:47 am - Vedika: I wish I was Shallow.
08/05/20, 2:47 am - Vedika: Life would be easier
08/05/20, 2:48 am - Tamal: I am way too practical for my own good.
08/05/20, 2:48 am - Vedika: I‚Äôd just worry about if he is cute and has a good body and I‚Äôll be happy
08/05/20, 2:48 am - Vedika: But I just don‚Äôt care about it now do I.
08/05/20, 2:49 am - Tamal: No okay. That's one way. But try the other.
Accept that you're a piece of shit and you deserve nothing good. Any good that passes by is a chance and eventually you'll slump and die.
08/05/20, 2:49 am - Tamal: That's more like it.
08/05/20, 2:49 am - Vedika: I was like you once
08/05/20, 2:49 am - Vedika: That‚Äôs bullshit
08/05/20, 2:50 am - Tamal: that's how I would describe me too. thank
08/05/20, 2:50 am - Vedika: I‚Äôm a piece of shit or not don‚Äôt matter
08/05/20, 2:50 am - Vedika: But hey
08/05/20, 2:50 am - Vedika: I would like to be flushed through the golden toilet seat
08/05/20, 2:50 am - Vedika: Than a public toilet
08/05/20, 2:51 am - Vedika: You are what you want to be
08/05/20, 2:51 am - Tamal: That's optimistic. I would ask myself whether I deserve that golden toilet seat and the answer would be no.
08/05/20, 2:51 am - Vedika: And if you‚Äôre choosing bad. You‚Äôre being stupid.
08/05/20, 2:51 am - Vedika: Bro
08/05/20, 2:51 am - Tamal: Yes. And maybe I want to be this.
08/05/20, 2:51 am - Vedika: No one gets what they deserve
08/05/20, 2:51 am - Tamal: Okay okay.
08/05/20, 2:51 am - Vedika: And you told you you‚Äôre the god
08/05/20, 2:51 am - Tamal: For argument's sake.
08/05/20, 2:51 am - Vedika: To decided what you get
08/05/20, 2:52 am - Tamal: Say I was optimistic. And thought I deserved better and everything falls to place and all that bs.
08/05/20, 2:52 am - Tamal: Now tell me what is going right with this world
08/05/20, 2:52 am - Vedika: Flushed from either toilets

08/05/20, 2:53 am - Tamal: People getting raped, murdered, looted. Governments, corrupt. Officials, greedy.
08/05/20, 2:53 am - Vedika: You‚Äôd rather enjoy the ride on the golden seat
08/05/20, 2:53 am - Tamal: What's right?
08/05/20, 2:53 am - Vedika: That‚Äôs not upto you
08/05/20, 2:53 am - Vedika: You can‚Äôt have a save the world complex
08/05/20, 2:53 am - Vedika: And not do anything about it either
08/05/20, 2:53 am - Vedika: Dekh
08/05/20, 2:53 am - Vedika: Your self worth is in your hands
08/05/20, 2:53 am - Tamal: But I  am a unit of the world right. So if a unit isn't correct how can you expect tthe whole thing to be right.
08/05/20, 2:53 am - Vedika: Jese you‚Äôll treat yourself
08/05/20, 2:54 am - Vedika: Vese other will too
08/05/20, 2:54 am - Vedika: *others will too
08/05/20, 2:54 am - Tamal: You're being an idealist.

08/05/20, 2:54 am - Vedika: I am one
08/05/20, 2:54 am - Vedika: And I‚Äôm good
08/05/20, 2:54 am - Vedika: You get what you attract
08/05/20, 2:54 am - Vedika: If I don‚Äôt like something I change it
08/05/20, 2:55 am - Vedika: You accept it and sit with you hands on your head saying yeh I deserved it
08/05/20, 2:55 am - Vedika: *your

08/05/20, 2:55 am - Vedika: there are millionaires getting richer
08/05/20, 2:55 am - Vedika: During the pandemic
08/05/20, 2:55 am - Vedika: You think they deserve to?
08/05/20, 2:56 am - Vedika: they are rapists walking free
08/05/20, 2:56 am - Vedika: They deserve to?
08/05/20, 2:56 am - Tamal: No. You know kiske liye life unfair hai. The poor. And they're like 80%
08/05/20, 2:56 am - Vedika: Take what you want
08/05/20, 2:56 am - Vedika: And enjoy it
08/05/20, 2:56 am - Vedika: Look complaining se nahi hoga kuch

08/05/20, 2:57 am - Tamal: Yeah. I would just watch the whole world burn and start over.
08/05/20, 2:57 am - Vedika: you‚Äôre being an idealist actually
08/05/20, 2:58 am - Vedika: this is perfect scenario
08/05/20, 2:58 am - Vedika: what I‚Äôm saying is just having a good life
08/05/20, 2:59 am - Tamal: no listen when I was little na I was a very academic guy. Still am. I used to do my homework religiously. Like nothing else mattered. But agar merese kuch nahi hota tha na then I will tear pages and kick my books and do all that.
08/05/20, 2:59 am - Tamal: when shit starts falling apart I would rather help it fall all at once than help it
08/05/20, 2:59 am - Tamal: *mend
08/05/20, 3:00 am - Vedika: that‚Äôs an impulse
08/05/20, 3:00 am - Tamal: that's exactly where I am rn
08/05/20, 3:00 am - Vedika: and you can control it if you want to
08/05/20, 3:00 am - Tamal: but no it feels good to hurt myself.

08/05/20, 3:01 am - Vedika: Oh. You haven‚Äôt felt hurt yet.

Don't undermine my feelings based upon yours.
08/05/20, 3:01 am - Vedika: Not undermining.
08/05/20, 3:02 am - Vedika: The world is gonna hurt you.
08/05/20, 3:02 am - Tamal: No what you just said was like someone got robbed and you're asking but yeah did you die?
08/05/20, 3:02 am - Vedika: No.
08/05/20, 3:02 am - Vedika: You‚Äôre being naive

08/05/20, 3:04 am - Vedika: look
08/05/20, 3:04 am - Vedika: the secret to having a good life
08/05/20, 3:04 am - Vedika: Is wanting it first. With true intentions
08/05/20, 3:04 am - Vedika: Not greed
08/05/20, 3:04 am - Vedika: Or status
08/05/20, 3:04 am - Vedika: Or whatever
08/05/20, 3:05 am - Vedika: You‚Äôre on a dopamine detox
08/05/20, 3:05 am - Vedika: And you don‚Äôt need it
08/05/20, 3:05 am - Tamal: You would right. I agree 
But what if you want it again and again and it just doesn't fucking happen. You'll eventually lose trust in the system right?
08/05/20, 3:05 am - Vedika: you‚Äôre gonna fail
08/05/20, 3:05 am - Vedika: Of course

08/05/20, 3:07 am - Tamal: Dude. You are asking me to be blind. Like how do you expect me to not see the crap I am engulfed in.
08/05/20, 3:07 am - Vedika: And you lose faith when something doesn‚Äôt work out say five times?
08/05/20, 3:07 am - Vedika: not blind no.

08/05/20, 3:11 am - Vedika: I don‚Äôt get why you are taking it personally
08/05/20, 3:11 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs not about you at all
08/05/20, 3:11 am - Vedika: Stop trying to victimise yourself
08/05/20, 3:12 am - Vedika: Jo bhi boy locker room mein tha
08/05/20, 3:12 am - Vedika: Was not related to you at all
08/05/20, 3:12 am - Tamal: listen the joke you sent me the other day na. I didn't find it funny. Kyun pata hai. 
1. I was disturbed
2. YOU sent it

I am betting on it ki koi aur kisi aur time pe bhejta I would have smiled. That's just us. You don't acknowledge it bas.
08/05/20, 3:12 am - Vedika: what joke
08/05/20, 3:12 am - Tamal: umm about some boob size.
08/05/20, 3:13 am - Tamal: sonakshi sinha I guess
08/05/20, 3:13 am - Vedika: It wasn‚Äôt funny no
08/05/20, 3:13 am - Tamal: I thought about it so much
08/05/20, 3:13 am - Vedika: I was appalled by it
08/05/20, 3:13 am - Tamal: I talked to a friend till 5 that morning
08/05/20, 3:13 am - Vedika: I sent it to many guys to see the reaction
08/05/20, 3:13 am - Tamal: I wrote to the women I sexted.
08/05/20, 3:13 am - Tamal: I don't know. I have lost trust in the system.
08/05/20, 3:13 am - Vedika: Those who responded positively were outta my life
08/05/20, 3:13 am - Vedika: dude you‚Äôre a man
08/05/20, 3:14 am - Vedika: Stop victimising please
08/05/20, 3:14 am - Vedika: It‚Äôs making me laugh
08/05/20, 3:14 am - Tamal: I can see that. You're like women are getting harrased and tujhe bada problem hai.
08/05/20, 3:14 am - Vedika: You fucking called it dark
08/05/20, 3:14 am - Tamal: That's what I meant when I said you won't get it.
08/05/20, 3:14 am - Vedika: And tried to rationalise it
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Vedika: So this is it?
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Tamal: No. What? No. Thats just an aspect
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Vedika: This is your pain?
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Tamal: What
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Vedika: the joke
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Tamal: Please stop with your diagnosis
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Vedika: The Sonakshi
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Vedika: Joke
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Tamal: No
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Vedika: You did what‚Äôs wrong with you
08/05/20, 3:15 am - Tamal: Yeah. I am not asking anybody to help too.
08/05/20, 3:16 am - Vedika: Listen
08/05/20, 3:16 am - Vedika: Stop trying to make about yourself
08/05/20, 3:16 am - Vedika: it‚Äôs not about yoh
08/05/20, 3:16 am - Vedika: *you
08/05/20, 3:16 am - Vedika: if you‚Äôre losing trust in the system just now
08/05/20, 3:17 am - Vedika: well then you need a history lesson
08/05/20, 3:17 am - Tamal: It is about me. Just think for a second rather than constantly trying to push a logic. Soch. Everything that's happening it's related to me. Agar na hota toh I wouldn't have fucking cared.
08/05/20, 3:17 am - Tamal: Koi kahi bhi mare mujhe usse kya
08/05/20, 3:17 am - Tamal: I care because kal ko it could be me.
08/05/20, 3:17 am - Tamal: Everything is about me. This whole system.
08/05/20, 3:17 am - Vedika: could you what
08/05/20, 3:17 am - Tamal: Otherwise no one would care.
08/05/20, 3:17 am - Vedika: Who‚Äôs exposed
